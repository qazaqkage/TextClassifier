ABSTRACT 
 
Today is difficult to imagine without integrated automated information systems (IAIS) that support various 
business processes. Obtaining aggregated information for the purpose of making management decisions 
depends on the effective interaction of information systems (IS) included in the structure of the IAIS. 
Business processes are often automated using software solutions of its own and third-party developers, 
regardless of their interconnectedness, which is especially true for universities. With constant changes in 
these business processes, IAIS developers are forced to adjust programs and data models, which leads to 
structural and semantic heterogeneity of information elements and, accordingly, the need to re-develop 
software data converters. The use of such solutions leads to complication and, consequently, a decrease in 
the reliability of the IAIS.  
This article continues the series of publications [25-27], which includes the problem of building integrated 
automated information systems that support various business processes based on ontologies. 
The purpose of the article is to develop a mathematical model, algorithm and software system for integrating 
IS data based on the application of the ontological approach. 
To achieve this goal, the following tasks were set. 
1. Build a mathematical model of data integration of information systems with heterogeneous ontological 
specifications. 
2. To develop a computational method for evaluating the semantic proximity of concepts (elements) of 
heterogeneous ontologies. 
 
 
Keywords:  Ontology description languages, data integration algorithms, genetic operator, lexical 
proximity, heterogeneous information systems. 
 
1 INTRODUCTION
One of the approaches to building an integrated 
automated information system is the integration of 
ready-made information systems.  
The process of data integration in the 
construction of IS is understood as ensuring the 
interaction of individual subsystems. The result of 
integration is the achievement of unity and integrity 
within the system. 
To improve the efficiency of integrated data 
processing, it is necessary to choose a method of 
integrating existing and ever-increasing information 
systems into a single information space. This need is 
especially acute when creating an integrated 
automated information system, which, on the one 
hand, provides users with access to relevant and 
consistent information, on the other hand, it is a 
necessary tool for the activities of university staff 
and student training. Analysis of correct and 
complete IS data affects the effectiveness of 
decisions made by the organization's management. 
Most universities have a significant number of 
information systems that are responsible for certain 
business processes. IS is created at different times by 
different groups of developers using dissimilar 
technological solutions. Some of them may not be 
documented or supported by the developers. These

systems are used, as a rule, by separate departments 
of the university. Only the users themselves 
(department employees) know about the structure 
and volume of stored information in the IS. 
Data 
integration 
of 
many 
heterogeneous 
information systems of a university is the main 
problem in the construction of complex systems, the 
solution of which is achieved through functional, 
technical, and software compatibility. The main step 
in creating an IS should be documenting all 
developments using standards, which guarantees the 
creation of successful systems. 
The main problems when integrating IS: 
1. Providing structured source information that is 
stored in parts in different systems and can be 
duplicated. One approach to solving this problem is 
to bring all data to a single structure.  
2. Providing uniform access to heterogeneous 
information systems, which were created on the 
basis of different technologies. One of the possible 
ways to solve this problem is to build a general 
integration architecture.  
3. Ensuring information exchange of all systems 
in the information space of the organization. 
4. The existence of various information models, 
as well as frequent changes in their structures, lead 
to the need to develop and improve methods and 
means of integrating heterogeneous information 
resources. 
The number of physical databases and the 
implementation features of the DBMS that control 
them are not the main criteria for assessing the 
complexity of the integration process. The key 
concept is the subject area of IP. The subject area of 
IP covers a certain area of the organization. Thus, 
""the subject area includes a set of concepts that can 
be operated on"" [1]. Relationships can exist between 
subject areas, for example, one subject area includes 
concepts from another. It is essential that there are 
fundamentally several subject areas related to the 
business processes of the university. 
Each information system of the university covers 
its own subject area. This leads to structural and 
semantic heterogeneity, when “data from different 
sources can be presented and organized differently, 
or similar concepts can be interpreted differently in 
different data sources” [2].  
The effect of heterogeneity is manifested with an 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
heterogeneous 
heterogeneous information systems with different 
functionality [1].  
IS heterogeneity has several aspects: 
The 
heterogeneity 
of 
requirements. 
IS 
development is carried out on the basis of the 
requirements of the relevant subject areas and is 
changed in the process of maintenance in connection 
with changes in their features. In addition, it is 
obvious that the requirements for the system due to 
different subject areas can be contradictory, which 
makes it necessary to choose the most important one. 
Difference in data models - ""data in different ISs 
can be represented in different ways and in different 
data models"" [2]. 
Syntactic heterogeneity - ""data can have a 
different representation when transmitted over a 
communication 
channel 
in 
accordance 
with 
interaction protocols (for example, binary, text, 
XML, etc.)"" [2]. 
Structural 
heterogeneity 
- 
in 
different 
information systems, data can be represented by 
different structures (""for example, a full name can be 
represented by one line or three lines"") [2]. 
Semantic heterogeneity - ""the same data can be 
represented in different systems of concepts, similar 
concepts can be interpreted in different ways in 
different IS"" [2]. 
Technical heterogeneity - integrated information 
systems are implemented using various technical 
solutions, from different manufacturers, have 
different methods and protocols of interaction for 
accessing the system, etc. [2]. 
Heterogeneity of data access methods - in 
particular, ""different purpose and expressiveness of 
query languages for retrieving data, different 
restrictions on the form of queries"" [2]. 
In this work, the problem of integrating these 
information systems is considered as the problem of 
integrating their subject areas.  
To solve the problem of semantic heterogeneity 
of information in the integration of information 
systems, one can use domain ontologies. 
The domain ontology includes concepts and 
relationships between them. The use of a unified 
ontology of subject areas to a certain extent allows 
us to solve the problem of heterogeneity at the level 
of conceptual semantics. However, in the IS 
subsystems of a university, different requirements 
are imposed on subject areas, the depth and formality 
of their description, therefore, heterogeneous 
ontological descriptions of the subject area, 
presented in heterogeneous ontological models, can 
be used. 
The heterogeneity of ontological specifications 
appears at the levels of model and conceptual 
semantics. Accordingly, there are problems of 
harmonizing ontological specifications. At the 
model level, differences are the factors that create 
heterogeneity: 
• in the syntax of languages defining ontological 
models;

• in the expressive ability of models; 
• in the semantics of primitives used in models. 
At the ontological level, heterogeneity gives rise 
to differences: 
 • in the names of concepts and relations; 
• in approaches to the definition of concepts; 
• in breaking the subject area into concepts; 
• in the coverage of the subject area; 
• in terms of the subject area. 
In order to correctly integrate heterogeneous 
information systems, it is necessary to find out the 
commonality and differences of the ontologies that 
underlie them, as well as agree on heterogeneous 
ontological specifications and then carry out 
information transformation. As a result, the joint 
work of heterogeneous information systems in the 
context of the problem domain at a semantically 
significant level is ensured. 
An analysis of the state of research on ontology 
reconciliation shows that these topics have not yet 
been investigated deeply enough, mainly for 
particular cases. The existing methods are mostly 
informal and need to be improved when used in 
another organization. 
When developing systems, the integration of 
ontologies is preferred to be avoided, despite the fact 
that this problem is relevant when using ontologies 
for the development of corporate information 
systems 
 
1.2. 
Analysis 
of 
integrated 
automated 
information systems of universities 
Today, universities use information technology 
as one of the powerful tools to improve the 
efficiency of work, teaching and research, as well as 
competitiveness. In a number of universities, work is 
underway to build an integrated automated 
information system to support educational, financial 
and management activities. Many IS subsystems are 
created on a variety of hardware and software in 
order to automate the activities of individual 
departments. From such systems, it is possible to 
obtain aggregated information in the form of a report 
only after the data converter programs have been 
revised for a specific task. 
The main task of IS is to automate the key areas 
of the university [3, 4]: the educational process 
(support for 
conducting 
classes, 
control of 
knowledge, etc.); management of the educational 
process (distribution of the teaching load between 
departments, teachers; scheduling classes, etc.); 
management 
of 
research 
activities; 
financial 
planning; management accounting; administrative 
management (management of the organizational 
structure, 
personnel, 
decision 
support, 
etc.); 
information resource management (user access to 
data, systems, etc.). Figure 1 shows the information 
flows of the university. 
""Communication is possible in three directions: 
a) vertical integration of information for strategic 
management, carried out on the basis of data 
obtained in the course of solving problems of 
operational management; b) horizontal integration of 
information - based on operations performed within 
the framework of solving tasks of one level of 
management; c) time integration of information - 
based on operations carried out with data related to 
different time periods. IS is also an important 
element in the implementation of feedback in the 
management scheme of a university. Based on 
information received from IS, decision makers, 
rector, vice rectors - have the ability to quickly assess 
the current situation, draw appropriate conclusions 
and form management decisions ""[3]. 
 
 
Figure 1: Place of IS in the university management 
scheme 
The IS of the university can be built on the basis 
of a unified technology (DBMS), which does not 
require data integration. But the disadvantages are:  
1) limited implementation of various functional 
requirements (there may be a need for functionality 
that cannot be implemented in the development 
technology used);  
2) the impossibility of linking into a single whole 
network, organizational infrastructure;  
3) limited use - by individual divisions or by 
users. 
An analysis of the IS of universities based on 
various technological solutions [5] showed that in 
most cases the integration of their own developments 
is carried out, which are used for the tasks of 
managing the educational process, scientific 
activities, and third-party systems for administrative 
management tasks. IS, developed on the basis of the 
concept of integration, cover various areas of the 
university and provide access to data for multiple

users, usually they are ""the environment of the entire 
university"" [5]. 
However, in universities, most information 
systems: 
- do not provide comprehensive support for 
making management decisions (for example, 
support for quality management processes); 
- are fragmented; 
- poorly adapted to adapt to changing functional 
requirements. 
As the analysis showed, the university, due to the 
large number of ISs that automate various business 
processes, has not solved the problem of integrating 
heterogeneous information resources. 
 
1.3 Basic approaches to the integration of 
information systems 
 
Data integration is one of the highest priority 
tasks of building IS. The problem of data integration 
arises when using information systems from 
different developers or with different database 
management systems (DBMS), as well as where it is 
necessary to get access to aggregated information. 
Before data integration, it is necessary to 
""identify and catalog the data, and build a data 
model"" [5]. In practice, the most suitable 
implementation technology (EDI, DCOM, OLAP, 
GIS, XML, Web services) is used to solve the data 
integration problem [5, 6]. 
There are several methods of data integration of 
information systems. 
The method of data dissemination is to transfer 
information from one IS to another after the 
occurrence of certain events. A distinctive feature of 
this method is the operational data exchange. Data is 
transferred both synchronously and asynchronously. 
The disadvantages include the impossibility of 
executing general analytical queries, since it may be 
necessary to use a temporary storage-analyzer, 
which is not provided for in this approach. 
When using the consolidation approach, data is 
extracted from multiple information systems and 
placed in one data warehouse. The repository 
seeding process is unidirectional and is divided into 
three phases - extract, transform, and load. There are 
several modifications of this approach, which can be 
attributed to the following categories: structure 
transfer and integration [7, 8, 9]. 
Migration also implies merging data structures. 
The integration process consists of combining the 
data model, metadata and the data itself in a new IS. 
In order to minimize costs, the developers of 
organizations use the transfer of structures. This 
allows you to reduce the number of servers used and, 
accordingly, the costs of their maintenance. It should 
be noted that transferring only structures is not part 
of the data integration process. 
The main stages in consolidation include: 
• definition of a single standard for IS and 
transition to it (definition of data warehouses and 
data marts); 
• creation of storage and data marts. This 
repository collects all data from source information 
systems and integrates them logically using 
identification keys and common measurements. This 
reduces the number of agent programs to retrieve 
data; 
• synchronization. In order to store general 
information about objects, a centralized operational 
data warehouse is used. 
Along with the data federation method, on-
demand data integration technology is used. In this 
case, a single virtual information space is formed and 
integration takes place in real time [10, 11]. ""The 
integration server accepts XQuery queries, parses 
these queries, separating individual queries to 
different data sources, optimizes them. Thus, if a 
query contains a call to several data sources, then it 
is divided into several separately executed 
subqueries. To obtain a resultant response, the 
results of the subqueries sewn together ""[4]. The 
disadvantages of the federalization method include 
low performance, which does not allow the use of 
servers in many tasks of the IS of the university. 
""With logical integration, based on existing 
descriptions, there is no need to generate specialized 
XQuery queries. One of the problems of the data 
integration server is the impossibility of describing 
the relationships between semantic objects, that is, 
context-sensitive relationships that are present in 
complex systems"" [4]. 
In [4], data integration is considered ""on the fly""; 
in real time, and it is an urgent task of building IS in 
the university. 
This approach solves the problem of not only the 
joint functioning of IS subsystems, but also the 
problem of their maintenance, since all changes in 
the integrated subsystems immediately become 
available to all users of the integration system and 
there are no special requirements for the hardware 
[4]. 
In the paper, the integration of information 
systems is understood as the process of establishing 
the mapping of heterogeneous ontologies of IS to 
ensure the joint operation of these systems. 
Companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, 
Business Objects, Sybase, SAS Institute, Cognos 
stand out among the leaders in the data integration 
software market.

IBM and Informatica are both involved in data 
integration technologies. The data integration 
product group provides data quality, support for 
unstructured sources of metadata management. A 
distinctive feature of this architecture is ""a metadata 
management 
environment 
and 
powerful 
mechanisms for parallel processing of large amounts 
of data"". It supports role-based interfaces that enable 
users to work with data. 
PowerCenter 8.5 is designed as a unified data 
integration platform, has a centralized metadata 
infrastructure, 
and 
integration 
functions 
are 
implemented as services. The system supports 
unstructured data access, batch data delivery, real-
time delivery, and retrieval of modified data only. 
PowerCenter AdvancedEdition allows you to extract 
metadata from a variety of sources and also provides 
metadata analysis tools. 
One of the popular integration products is 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) (provides 
application and data integration). The main idea 
behind this approach is to view the most important 
business functions of an organization as a collection 
of services. The data is in the source systems, and 
even the location of the data is unknown, each data 
source is associated with a specific service. When 
requested from the user, services are called. One of 
the disadvantages of this approach is the limited 
number of requests to retrieve information [12, 13]. 
The SOA architecture is based on the Web-
Service technology [4]. Web services exchange 
messages using specific protocols: WSDL (Web 
Service Request Description Language), SOAP 
(Structured 
Messaging 
Protocol), 
and 
XML 
(Extensible Markup Language) [4]. The main 
advantages of this technology are: independence 
from the IS development environment and ease of 
creating web services. There are also a number of 
security and performance disadvantages [29, 4]. 
The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) approach is 
based on the use of asynchronous messaging 
between information systems through a single point 
according to the SOA principle [4]. Using this 
approach, you can provide access to data from third-
party information systems. Based on the work [4], 
the disadvantage of this approach is that the 
integration of a new information system requires 
""the involvement of developers who implement the 
necessary functionality in information systems, 
ensuring the generation and processing of messages"" 
[4]. 
Thus, there are many different data integration 
solutions from different software vendors. It should 
be noted that actively developing these solutions 
make it possible to solve almost any integration 
problem by modifying it for specific information 
systems. 
Therefore, information systems cannot be limited 
only to the use of one of these solutions, but it is 
necessary to provide support for other technologies 
that ensure data integration. 
Constant changes in business processes and 
infrastructure 
of 
an 
organization 
require 
modification of information systems subsystems and 
data models, which leads to re-development of 
converter applications for data integration. 
The analysis showed that the existing integration 
technologies ensure data integration at the physical, 
logical and semantic levels. Integration at the 
physical level seems to be the simplest task, since 
data from heterogeneous sources are converted into 
the required universal format. When integrating data 
at the logical level, the local data model is mapped 
to the global one. This generates a number of 
conflicts, in particular: the use of different terms to 
designate the same concepts; various kinds of 
semantic conflicts. Given the complexity of the task 
at hand, to solve the problem of heterogeneity, it is 
necessary to use a data integration approach based 
on semantics. 
 
1.4 Using the ontological approach as a basis for 
the integration of information systems 
 
Today, a significant amount of knowledge is 
accumulating in heterogeneous information systems. 
And when integrating such systems, the problem of 
systematization and structural representation of 
knowledge about different subject areas arises. To 
solve this problem, ontological models can be used 
in order to obtain a formal specification of 
conceptualization. 
Ontological 
specification 
includes a combination of a formalized description 
of knowledge in the form of axioms and an informal 
description. 
As noted in [15, 16], the ontology-based 
approach is used in various fields from knowledge 
representation to information integration. Ontology 
is used in knowledge management systems in order 
to formally describe the modeled part of the world in 
the form of a dictionary shared by specialists in the 
selected subject area. Based on this common 
vocabulary, various sources of knowledge can be 
integrated. Thus, using a common vocabulary, it is 
possible to understand and compare various 
information systems. 
Ontology can be used at the stages of 
development and operation of an information 
system.

Ontology is defined as a specification of the 
conceptualization of the subject area and as a means 
of representing the semantics of information units 
[7]. As noted in [1], ""the domain ontology can be 
used to describe information objects, their properties 
and relationships."" Information about these objects 
can be stored in different sources, and to see the 
complete picture, it is necessary to build an 
information model [2]. 
In the works of scientists [1, 4] in knowledge 
management systems ontology is the basis for the 
formation of an organization's knowledge base. In 
work, an ontology is used to create an information 
and educational environment. In these cases, we are 
talking about the organization of intelligent storage 
of unstructured data. At the same time, such a data 
warehouse is not connected with other subsystems of 
information systems. 
At 
present, 
automated 
data 
processing 
technologies cover the level of their semantics. With 
an increase in the amount of processed information 
from heterogeneous data sources, the problem of 
heterogeneity of ontological specifications arises. 
Therefore, there may be problems of harmonizing 
ontological models. The article proposes a method 
for integrating heterogeneous ontologies of subject 
areas. 
Ontologies are classified as follows: 
Top level. It contains general knowledge for 
several subject areas. It can describe the most 
general concepts such as space, time, event, object, 
action, etc. 
Domain-oriented. The purpose is similar to the 
top-level ontology, but the area of interest is limited 
to one subject area (for example, the educational 
process). At the same time, it can use the 
specialization of terms that are located in the top-
level ontology. It is used by subject matter experts to 
annotate information. 
Task-oriented. These are ontologies used by 
specific application programs and containing terms 
that are used in the development of information 
systems that perform specific tasks. 
Quite often, within the framework of one 
organization, ontologies of subject areas are 
developed and combined by different uncoordinated 
groups of experts. This leads to the fact that several 
semantically 
heterogeneous 
or 
independently 
developed from each other ontologies describe one 
subject area. Subsystems in information systems 
have 
their 
own 
particular 
ontologies 
and 
organizational differences. In such conditions, the 
tasks of displaying and integrating ontologies 
inevitably arise. In the general case, the integration 
of two ontologies will mean the process of creating 
a new ontology based on finding the similarity of 
their elements, taking into account the semantic 
features. 
 
1.4.1 Methodology for building ontologies 
The methodology for constructing an ontology 
involves solving the following problems [15]: 
• define the purpose and scope; 
• build an ontology using a specialized 
knowledge representation language; 
• achieve a common understanding of the 
structure of information; 
• ensure the use of knowledge in the subject area; 
When creating an ontology, it is necessary: 
1. Conduct an ontological analysis. A glossary of 
terms is compiled, which includes a description of 
the characteristics of objects and processes included 
in the information system. The logical relationships 
between the concepts of the subject area are also 
described; 
2. to highlight concepts - basic concepts; 
3. determine the number of levels of abstraction; 
4. distribute concepts by levels; 
5. Build connections between concepts - define 
relationships and relationships with basic concepts; 
6. to consult with various experts to eliminate 
contradictions and inaccuracies. 
The ontology contains a set of terms and rules by 
which one can build reliable statements about the 
state of the information system under consideration. 
The article uses the IDEF5 methodology to 
model and visualize ontologies. It developed 
""special languages that are used to represent 
information about the ontology in a transparent 
graphical form"" [19]. 
When constructing an ontology, the following 
must be done: 
1) create a dictionary of terms; 
2) describe the rules and restrictions by which 
reliable statements can be formed; 
3) based on the statements, build a model that 
allows you to form the necessary additional 
statements. 
There are four types of diagrams in the IDEF5 
methodology: 
• ""classification diagram (Classification 
Schematics) - intended for the logical 
systematization of knowledge""; 
• ""Composition Schematics - intended for 
graphical presentation of the composition of 
ontology concepts""; 
• ""Relation Schematics - for visualization and 
study of relationships between concepts in 
ontology"";

• ""object state diagram (Object State Schematics) 
- a tool for documenting processes in terms of 
changing the state of an object"". 
In the IDEF5 methodology, knowledge in the 
form of a set of concepts, attributes and relationships 
is used to build a conceptual model. Thus, using the 
IDEF5 methodology, it is possible to visually 
represent the state of objects throughout the entire 
process and effectively develop and study an 
ontology. 
The structure and properties of the information 
system of the university can be analyzed using a 
dictionary of terms in order to describe the 
characteristics of objects and processes related to the 
system. 
 
1.4.2 Formal Ontology Model 
Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts 
(concepts) in the considered domain, properties and 
attributes of each concept (slots), and restrictions 
imposed on slots (facets). Slots are sometimes 
referred to as roles [29]. ""Ontology together with a 
set of individual instances of concepts forms a 
knowledge base. In reality, it is difficult to 
distinguish between an ontology and a knowledge 
base"" [3]. 
In [1], the formal model of the ontology is 
presented in the form of a ""triplet of finite sets"" O = 
<T, R, F>, where: 
𝑇 - terms of the subject area described by the 
ontology 𝑂;  
𝑅 - relations between terms of a given subject 
area; 
𝐹 - interpretation functions defined on terms 
and/or relations ontologies 𝑂 [1]. 
Relationships mean the type of interaction 
between concepts 
(""Part-whole"", ""is a subclass"", ""has an effect"", 
""similar to"", etc.). The axioms [1] are used to model 
statements. 
To describe complex systems, such as the IS of 
an university, such a concept as an extensible 
ontology model is introduced. 
 
1.4.3 Methods for assessing semantic proximity in 
ontologies 
The ontological approach provides a new level in 
solving information integration problems. 
To 
ensure 
the 
semantically 
correct 
interconnection 
of 
heterogeneous 
information 
systems, it is necessary to compare the ontologies 
that underlie them and find out their commonality 
and differences. This problem is solved by using 
methods for assessing the semantic proximity of 
ontology concepts. 
Many well-known methods for finding a measure 
of proximity between ontology concepts are based 
on Tversky's set-theoretic approach, based on 
comparing the properties of concepts. 
In [22, 21, 6, 20], the structure of paths between 
concepts is considered, namely, the length of the 
shortest path is determined as the number of 
concepts in the hierarchy between the two 
considered concepts in the ontology, ""the shorter the 
path length, the closer they are"" [22]. 
In [7], proximity is estimated as a semantic 
distance, it is inversely proportional to the semantic 
proximity of concepts. 
In [8], the measure is based on the frequency of 
occurrence of the concept and its subclasses, and is 
interpreted as a probability value. 
The disadvantage of the methods described 
above for calculating proximity measures based on 
ontological structures is their symmetry. According 
to expert estimates, the measure of proximity is not 
always symmetrical in most cases. 
In [9], an asymmetric measure of semantic 
proximity is proposed, which takes into account the 
directions of passage along the edges. Here, the 
concept child is semantically closer to the concept 
parent than the concept parent is to the concept child. 
In [10], a calculation method is described, the 
essence of which is that the proximity of two 
concepts depends on the proximity of concepts with 
which there are hierarchical relationships, and is 
calculated recursively. 
Hybrid 
measures 
that 
combine 
several 
approaches seem to be the most promising. 
The hybrid measure proposed in consists of three 
parts - taxonomic, relational, and attributive. 
Difficulties in comparing different ontologies of 
subject areas lie in the difference in the names of 
concepts and relations, as well as in the approaches 
to the definition of concepts. When mapping two 
ontologies, a search is performed for each concept of 
one ontology of a similar concept of another 
ontology. 
In [24], to establish a mapping of two ontologies, 
the concept of bridges is used — vertices in a 
taxonomy that correspond to equivalent concepts. 
The closest common parent of the compared 
concepts is taken into account here. 
In [11], a method for calculating a measure is 
proposed, taking into account the lexical proximity 
of concepts, properties, domains and ranges of 
relations (ranges of values of the arguments of 
relations), parent / child concepts. 
The works [10, 14] consider the verbal and 
conceptual levels, where the lexicons are compared

and the taxonomies of the concepts of two ontologies 
are compared. 
The main disadvantage of most methods for 
determining semantic proximity is the need to 
involve an expert to confirm the correctness of 
detecting similarities and differences in semantic 
concepts. 
 
1.4.4 Ontology description languages 
In order to implement an ontology, it is necessary to 
choose an Ontology specification language that has 
sufficient expressive power. Such a language makes 
it possible to indicate the machine-interpreted 
semantics of systems and brings it closer to the real 
world, which significantly increases the expressive 
capabilities of conceptual modeling. 
Ontology specification languages are divided 
into simple ones, into languages based on descriptive 
logic and frames (OKBC, OCML, Flogic), as well as 
on Web standards (XOL, RDF (S), DAML, OIL, 
OWL, SHOE, UPML) [1]. 
Traditional languages and Web-languages of 
ontology specification (Ontolingua, CycL) are 
distinguished by expressive capabilities of the 
domain description and some inference mechanisms. 
They include constructions for multiple hierarchies 
of concepts, inference rules, axioms, as well as the 
ability to record ontologies and relationships 
between them. 
Language 
RDF 
(Resource 
Description 
Framework). This standard for describing metadata 
is based on XML syntax. ""RDF uses a data model - 
object, attribute, value"". RDF allows you to describe 
many objects of information systems in the form of 
a directed graph. RDF dictionaries use a basic 
structure to describe concepts and the types of 
relationships between them. This standard can be 
expanded. For example, you can define the structure 
of a source description using concepts such as 
concepts, properties, types, collections. There are 
several software products that allow you to describe 
RDF triplets for various types of information 
systems. RDF Schema (RDFS) is a standard for 
describing 
domain 
models 
using 
resources, 
properties and their values. Thesauri can be 
described by means of RDFS. One of the 
disadvantages of RDFS is the impossibility of 
specifying axioms and inference rules based on 
them. 
DAML + OIL [22] is a semantic language for 
creating ontologies that contains a rich set of 
constructs (headers, concept elements, property 
elements, instances). 
OWL (Web Ontology Language) is ""a language 
for describing ontologies based on the XML, RDF, 
RDFS and DAML + OIL standards"". The language 
is based on the data model ""object - property"", which 
allows you to describe classes and the relationship 
between them. The formal basis of this language is 
descriptive logic, which allows you to significantly 
expand the expressive capabilities of the system. 
 
  
Figure 2: Diagram of the use of various formats for 
describing ontologies when importing and exporting data 
 
To build ontologies, many ontology editors have 
been developed that support various languages and 
formats for representing ontologies. According to 
the study [1], the results of which are presented in 
Figure 2, the most commonly used format for 
representing ontologies is RDF (S). This standard 
has a convenient 
Percentage of use for perception by the form of 
data representation in the form of a directed graph. 
 
1.4.5 Tools for ontology processing 
It is possible to speak about the task of integrating 
ontologies in order to harmonize ontological 
concepts only when heterogeneous ontologies reflect 
either different points of view on the same subject 
area, or on overlapping subject areas. 
One of the advantages of using ontology for the 
integration of information systems is the availability 
of software that supports ontological analysis. There 
are a number of tools (Ontolingua, OntoEdit, OilEd, 
WebOnto, ODE) that support editing, documenting, 
visualizing, importing and exporting ontologies, as 
well as merging and comparison. Let's consider the 
most famous of them. 
Protégé is a freeware editor for designing domain 
ontologies. An editor to build ontologies using the 
OWL language. 
Such tools are used both for design and for 
ontology analysis, performing typical operations, for 
example: 
• 
alignment 
- 
finding 
and 
establishing 
correspondences in both ontologies; 
• mapping - finding semantic dependencies 
between elements of different ontologies;

• union - creation of the resulting ontology for the 
other two. 
PROMPT is an extension of the Protégé system 
and serves to unify and group ontologies. PROMPT 
displays to the user a list of operations for combining 
two ontologies, as well as a list of conflicts and their 
possible solutions. ""The user selects the required 
action, the list is formed again until a new ontology 
is ready"". 
Chimaera is ""a program for integrating 
ontologies based on the Ontolingua editor"". It 
provides the user with the result of the analysis of the 
union of ontologies, pointing out problem areas, but 
does not take any action on its own. Only concept 
names and their taxonomy are checked. 
OntoMerge provides tools for translating data 
into a generic representation in a special language. 
Then the axioms of connection between the concepts 
of two ontologies are determined. 
OntoMorph offers a set of actions that can be 
applied to an ontology. 
OBSERVER allows you to find synonyms in the 
original ontologies and provides the user with 
information about the mapping of ontologies for 
formulating queries in terms of their own ontology. 
ONION is a tool for combining ontologies using 
ontology algebra. 
Developments in this direction for the mapping 
of ontological models are mainly related to specific 
models or their concepts. There are few works on 
methods of displaying arbitrary information models. 
Some of them are based on methods for constructing 
functions 
for 
displaying 
model 
elements. 
Noteworthy is the research [18] that is devoted to 
mapping models based on specifications. 
The solution of the ontology mapping problem is 
reduced to the construction of an interface to the 
system that uses the most general means of ontology 
specification. Thus, the ontological model OKBC 
(Open Knowledge Base Connectivity) uses the 
frame model as a basis and serves as an exchange 
language for ontologies. The programming interface 
is considered as a key tool for the architecture of a 
distributed ontology repository. OKBC is part of the 
Ontolingua server. Constructs consist of classes, 
frames, slots and some relationship properties. 
The existing methods of displaying ontological 
models do not take into account their specificity. 
Therefore, in this case, one can focus on research on 
the mapping of information models that are not 
related to ontology. The specificity of ontology 
mapping is associated with the types of entities and 
relationships used in many ontological models. 
Using the existing methods, it is impossible to 
integrate ontologies created by different working 
groups without the participation of an expert. 
 
2 USING RDF TO BUILD INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS MODELS 
 
RDF is a data presentation model. RDF uses 
elements from SGML and XML. ""Entities are 
described by specifying their properties and the 
values of these properties"" [1]. RDF resource claims 
are: 
• the described entity - the subject; 
• property is a predicate; 
• property value - object. 
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and URI 
reference (URI with fragment identifier) are used to 
designate subjects, objects and properties [1]. 
The structure of an RDF specification consists of 
a description of all information objects. The latter 
consists of a link to the described information object 
(via URI) and descriptions of properties (Name; 
value; link to another information object). 
To express semantics, you need to create a 
dictionary of terms. For this purpose, you can use the 
language RDFS, which is an extension of RDF. It 
contains tools for defining classes, properties and 
rules. 
Benefits of using RDF: 
• RDF is web-oriented and is good at 
• scalable; 
• RDF - ontologies are published by any user on 
the web in order to expand existing concepts 
(relationships) with new concepts, if required; 
• URIs are used as global identifiers for all 
concepts, making it easier to manage the global URI 
namespace through the use of the Domain Name 
System (DNS). 
Thus, the description of an ontology using OWL 
and RDF/RDFS technology allows better expressing 
the semantics of all entities and their internal and 
external relationships. As a result, they can be used 
for the effective functioning of the developed 
ontology integration algorithms. 
 
2.1 Mathematical model of data integration of 
information systems 
 
An integration algorithm is proposed based on 
the results of comparing concepts, their attributes 
and relationships between concepts [13]. In addition, 
a generalization of the problem of combining 
ontologies to the procedure of integrating ontologies 
describing different subject areas of the same 
domain of subject areas is proposed. The task of

integrating information systems is reduced to the 
task of constructing mappings and integrating 
ontologies, and then establishing interconnections 
between the schemes of integrated information 
systems, i.e. preserving the correspondence of a set 
of ontologies of information systems to a given set 
of 
semantic 
dependencies, 
allowing 
the 
establishment of interaction between information 
systems. RDF statements are used to describe the 
ontological specifications of information systems to 
be integrated. 
As a rule, the object schema of information 
systems includes elements that correspond to the 
entities of different subject areas, each object is 
characterized by the values of a set of attributes and 
is represented as a set of ordered pairs of the form 
 
𝑢 � � 𝑎�, 𝑑� �,               (1) 
where 𝑎𝑖 is an attribute of the object; 𝑑𝑖 - the value 
of the attribute 𝑖 ∈ �1 . . . 𝑛�; 𝑛 - number of 
attributes.  
The basic concept of the proposed model is concept 
C (class of objects). Each concept of an information 
system ontology defined as a unit of knowledge and 
identified by name and characterized by type. 
Therefore, we define the concept as 
 
𝐶𝑖 � �𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑖, 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑖�,             (2) 
where 𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑖 is a unique name (identifier) of the 𝑖 � 
concept; 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑖 - the type of the 𝑖-concept (abstract, 
representable, or composite). An abstract type is a 
list, an array, etc.  
The representable type is numbers, strings, 
images, etc. Composite type is an aggregation of 
heterogeneous or homogeneous structures (concept, 
attribute, relation). Below is an example that defines 
concepts with abstract types 
 
(Premises, Streaming Lecture Audience, Room 
Capacity).  
{Ontology Auditor Fund; in: module;  
kind: ontology; type:  
{Premises;  
in: type, concept;  
Capacity of the Premises: Capacity of the 
Premises; metaslot  
inverse: Capacity of the room.From the room. 
end  
},  
{Stream Lecture Audience; in: type, concept;  
supertype: Premise; Area of the room:  
{in: predicate, invariant;  
{predicative; {  
all a / Stream Lecture Audience (a. Room 
Capacity> 50)  
}}}},  
{Capacity of the Premises; in: type, concept; 
Room: Premises;  
metaslot  
inverse: Room.CapacityPlace;  
end  
};  
} 
 
Let's set the following set of concepts 𝐶 �
�𝐶�|𝑖 � 1,2, … , 𝑛� and a set of relations between 
concepts 
𝑅 � 𝑅�, 𝑅�, 𝑅� ,              (3) 
where 𝑅� is an inheritance relation (class-subclass 
relationship), 𝑅�,𝐶�, 𝐶� 
where 𝐶� is a superclass of the 𝐶� concept;  
𝑅� - aggregation relation (part-whole relationship), 
𝑅��𝐶�, 𝐴� attributes of the 𝐶� concept are included in 
the set of attributes of all 𝐴 concepts.  
𝑅� is an association relation (semantic relations) 
with the property of transitivity.  
Formally, we represent the ontology of an 
information system in the following form: 
 
𝑂 �� 𝐶, 𝐴, 𝐿, 𝑃�, 𝑃�, 𝑅 �,            (4) 
where 𝐶 �  𝐶𝑖 𝑖 � 1,2, . . . , 𝑛 – many concepts;  
𝐴 � �𝑎��|𝑖𝑗 � 1,2, … , 𝑗� − many attributes of 
concepts; 
𝐿 � �𝑙��|𝑖𝑘 � 1,2, … , 𝑘� – vocabulary that defines 
the professional terms of the organization; 
𝑃�: 𝐶 → 2�– a mapping that defines a set of 
attributes for each concept;  
𝑃�: 𝐶 → 2� – functions and concept interpretation, 
maps to a concept a set of vocabulary terms 𝐿;  
𝑅 – many relationships between concepts. An 
information system using the O ontology is 
presented in the form 
 
𝑈� �� 𝑂, 𝑈, 𝑃�, 𝑃� �,               (5) 
where 𝑈 � �𝑢1 , 𝑢2 , . . . , 𝑢𝑛 � – set of elements of 
the IS object scheme;  
𝑃�: 𝑈 → 𝐶 – mapping that associates an object 
schema element with its concept;  
𝑃�: 𝑈 � 𝑈 → 𝑅 – a mapping that associates 
relations between the elements of the object schema 
in the ontology, and for any element 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 the 
following condition is satisfied: the set of attributes 
of the object schema element 𝑢 corresponds to the 
attributes of its concept, i.e.�𝑎: �  𝑎, 𝑑 �∈  𝑢� �
𝑃� �𝑃��𝑢��

We denote by 𝐻� the set of heterogeneous 
information systems based on the ontology 𝑂. 
We denote the change in the information system

𝑈�����𝐿�, 𝑈� � 𝑈�����𝑈� 
Different ontologies of information systems 
included in 𝑂 may have overlapping sets of 
attributes, relationships, and concepts. On the basis 
of several initial ontologies, the resulting ontology is 
built while maintaining the original specifications in 
such a way that it includes all possible relationships 
between concepts and does not contain equivalent 
(duplicate) concepts. For this, it is necessary that the 
mappings 𝑃�, 𝑃�, 𝑃�, 𝑃� on the same ontology 
concepts coincide. 
The 
resulting 
ontology 
determines 
the 
correspondence of concepts and the rules for their 
interpretation between information systems, which 
allows 
them 
to 
successfully 
establish 
their

2.2 Semantic dependencies 
 
The construction of the mapping of the ontology 
𝑂�to the ontology 𝑂� consists in finding for each 
concept of the ontology 𝑂� a similar concept of the 
ontology 𝑂�. 
As a rule, information systems should not only 
correspond to a certain structural scheme, but also 
satisfy more stringent requirements that are imposed 
by 
various 
semantic 
dependencies. 
Such 
dependencies determine the permissible states of the 
information system and are used to consistently 
change data in information systems. To implement a 
coordinated change of data into information systems 
in the context of the problem domain, it is necessary 
to find out the commonality and differences of 
information systems ontologies, to agree on 
ontological specifications. For this, semantic 
proximity is determined and semantic dependencies 
are established between the elements of ontologies 
(concepts). Thus, the goal of integration is to 
preserve the correspondence of the set of ontologies 
of information systems to a given set of semantic 
dependencies. 
The semantic dependence defined on the 
ontology 𝑂 is taken as a z-predicate defined on 𝑂�. 
If there is a semantic dependence z in the 
ontology 𝑂, then we will write 𝑧�𝑂�.  
The 
set 
of 
semantic 
dependencies 
𝑍 �
�𝑧�, 𝑧�, 𝑧�, 𝑧�, 𝑧��  has the consistency property, if  ∃ 
∃ 𝑧��𝑂�∀𝑖�1 � 𝑖 � 5�. 
Consider 2 ontologies 𝑂�and 𝑂�:  
𝑂� �� 𝐶�, 𝐴�, 𝐿�, 𝑃�
�, 𝑃�
�, 𝑅� � − ontology of one 
information system;  
𝑂� �� 𝐶�, 𝐴�, 𝐿�, 𝑃�
�, 𝑃�
�, 𝑅� � − ontology of 
other information systems; 
𝑛 − number of concepts in ontology 𝑂�; 
𝑚 − number of concepts in ontology 𝑂�. 
In practice, the dependence between ontologies 
must be reduced to the dependencies between the 
concepts that they include. They were reviewed, 
analyzed and assigned to the following 5 groups: 
1. 
Equivalence 
𝑧�: 𝑚𝑎𝑝�𝐶�� �
𝐶�,, 𝑖𝑓 𝑆�𝐶�, 𝐶�� � 𝑏, where 𝑏 is the threshold value 
of the semantic proximity measure 𝑆�𝐶�, 𝐶��, at 
which the mapping of the concept 𝐶� to the ontology 
𝑂� is constructed.  
The coincidence of all attributes of the concept 
𝐶�
� of one ontology 𝑂� with all attributes of the 
concept 𝐶�
� of another ontology 𝑂2 (element-wise 
equality of the sets 𝐴�, 𝐴�) means equality of the 
content of the two concepts.

2.3 Method for evaluating semantic proximity 
between information systems ontologies 
 
The ontologies of integrable information systems 
are initially not connected in any way; therefore, it is 
necessary to find semantically similar elements of 
ontologies. 
The construction of a mathematical model for the 
integration of information systems, taking into 
account the comparison of their ontological 
specifications, creates an opportunity to measure the 
proximity (similarity) of ontological concepts. 
In solving problems of displaying and integrating 
ontologies, information retrieval and building 
queries, entering new documents, an important role 
is played by the assessment of the semantic 
proximity of concepts and instances. Initially, the 
assessment of semantic proximity was based on the 
statement: the more information separates two 
concepts, the closer they are (geometric approach). 
But then a more objective set-theoretic approach was 
proposed by Tversky. Its idea is that in order to 
assess the semantic proximity, it is necessary to take 
into account not only the general properties of 
objects, but also their various properties. 
For a numerical assessment of the semantic 
proximity of ontology concepts, an approach based 
on the research results of A.F. Tuzovsky and 
professor at the University of Mannheim A. 
Maedche. In the proposed method, the proximity 
measure consists of three parts. Attributive measure 
(comparison of concept attributes and attribute 
values), taxonomic measure (determination of the 
degree of similarity of ontology concepts based on 
their relative position, the length of the shortest path 
is calculated as the number of concepts in the 
hierarchy between the two considered concepts in 
the ontology, the shorter the path length, the closer 
they are) and a relational measure (takes into account 
relationships with other concepts). 
This method has been adapted to calculate the 
semantic 
proximity 
of 
two 
heterogeneous 
ontologies. The modification of this method consists 
in replacing the taxonomic component with lexical 
correspondence (lexical proximity is based on the 
distance between two concepts of ontologies (the 
number of characters for transforming one lexeme 
into another)), as well as in the method of finding the 
attributive component and the use of a genetic 
algorithm for finding weight coefficients. In this 
case, the definition of the lexical component is 
calculated as the ratio of the intersection of sets of 
words (synonyms) in terms of their union. The main 
advantages of the proposed approach are in finding 
key concepts, eliminating the subjectivity of their 
descriptions and dependence on the points of view of 
ontology developers. 
Let us define 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, 
respectively, as a measure of the proximity of two 
concepts based on their position, based on the 
comparison of their relations, based on the

comparison of attributes and values attributes of 
concepts.  
The weighting factors 𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎 allow you to 
regulate the process of calculating the semantic 
proximity of two concepts.  
To assess the lexical proximity of two concepts 
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, the sets of terms of the concepts 𝑃𝐿��𝑐�� 
and 𝑃𝐿��𝑐�� are compared, common and different 
elements are found: 
 
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � �
1, 𝑖𝑓 𝑐� � 𝑐�
|�������∩�������|
|�������∪�������| 𝑖𝑓 𝑐� � 𝑐�       (9) 
 
where 𝑃𝐿��𝑐�� � �𝐿� ∈ 𝐿|𝑃��𝑐�� � 𝐿�� − many 
lexical terms of the concept 𝑐𝑖.  
Below is an example of the many terms of the 
Audience concept.

Term_section:

Premises;

}. 
To assess relational proximity, it is assumed that 
if two concepts have the same relationship 
𝑅�, 𝑅�, 𝑅� with the third concept, then they are more 
similar than two concepts that have different 
relationships. 
Let's pretend that 𝐶��𝑐�� � �𝑐� ∈ 𝐶|𝑅��𝑐�, 𝑐�� ∨
𝑅��𝑐�,𝑐�� ∨ 𝑅��𝑐�,𝑐�� ∨ 𝑐� � 𝑐�� − set containing 
concepts that have relationships 𝑅�, 𝑅�, 𝑅�. Let us 
define the concept associativity relation as 
𝑅��𝑐�� � �𝑐�: 𝑐� ∈ 𝐶��𝑐���              (10) 
Let's calculate the sum of the values of the lexical 
measure of proximity for concepts from the set 
𝑅��𝑐�� and 𝑅��𝑐��. 
 
𝑆�� �𝑅��𝑐��, 𝑅��𝑐��� � ∑ 𝑐� ∈ 𝑅��𝑐��, 𝑐� ∈
𝑅��𝑐��𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� (11) 
The relational proximity measure 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� 
allows you to assess the similarity of two concepts 
based on the similarity of concepts from the set

Let's compare the attributes of the two concepts.  
Let's set a set of attributes belonging to the concept 
𝑐𝑖.  
𝐴�� � �𝐴�
��, 𝑘 ∈ �1 … 𝑛��� where 𝑛�- number of 
concept attributes 𝑐𝑖. 
𝐴�� � �𝐴�
��, 𝑘 ∈ �1 … 𝑛��� where 𝑛�- number of 
concept attributes 𝑐j. 
The attributive measure of proximity 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� of 
concepts с� and с� is determined by the 
correspondence of their common attributes 𝐴�� ∩ 
𝐴��. 
The attributive measure of proximity 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� 
satisfies 
the 
axioms 
of 
independence 
and 
decidability and is defined by the formula 
 
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� �
|���∩ ���|
|���∩ ���|            (13) 
where 𝐴�� −many concept attributes с�; 
𝐴�� − many concept attributes с�.  
The measure of proximity 𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐�� of concepts с� 
ontology 𝑂 and с� ontology 𝑂� is defined as  
 
𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐�� � �𝑡 ∙ 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 𝑟 ∙ 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 𝑎 ∙
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐���, (14)  
 
where 𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎 − coefficients that determine the 
importance of proximity measures 
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐��, 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� respectively,  
𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎 ∈ �1; 0�, 𝑡 � 𝑟 � 𝑎 � 1, 𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐�� ∈ �1; 0� 
 
�𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 1, if concepts are equivalent ,
𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 0, if concepts are different.  
 
2.4 Genetic algorithm for finding weighting 
factors 
 
To solve the problem of finding the weight 
coefficients, it is proposed to use a genetic algorithm 
that most effectively provides a solution for 
functions with several extrema. A modified genetic 
algorithm was used as the general structure of the 
algorithm.

The genetic algorithm is a heuristic algorithm 
that includes the principles of natural evolution and 
the idea of ""survival of the fittest"". The solution is 
encoded as a sequence of genes, which is called an 
individual. 
The task of assessing the semantic proximity of 
ontology concepts belongs to the group of 
constrained optimization problems. Let's represent it 
as follows: 
 
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑓�,�,��𝑥̅�𝑥̅ � �𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎� ∈ 𝐹 ⊆ 𝑆 
𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎 ∈ �0; 1� 
𝑡 � 𝑟 � 𝑎 � 1, 
𝑥̅ – a solution vector satisfying all constraints is 
called a feasible solution; 
F – range of feasible solutions; 
S – whole search area. 
We formulate the optimization problem as 
follows: it is necessary to find 𝑥 ̅� ∈ 𝐹, such that 
𝑓�,�,��𝑥̅� � 𝑓�,�,��𝑥̅�∀𝑥̅ ∈ 𝐹 
We construct a chromosome, which consists of a 
set of genes 𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎. The objective function is based 
on the use of Euclidean distance:  
 
𝑓�,�,� � ∑
�𝑡 ∙ 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 𝑟 ∙
��∈��,��∈��
𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 𝑎 ∙ 𝑆��𝑐�, 𝑐�� � 1�
�         (15)  
 
 
1. Initialization 
The initial population is given by a randomly 
generated set of values with the following 
restrictions 𝑡, 𝑟, 𝑎 ∈ �0; 1 , 𝑡 � 𝑟 � 𝑎 � 1. The type 
of such a population is presented in Table 1, where n 
is the population size.

The fitness function is the target function (15). 
 
2. Selection 
2.1 The coefficient of fitness is calculated for 
each chromosome. 
2.2 Those chromosomes are selected that will 
participate in the creation of descendants by the 
method of tournament selection (Figure 3). All 
chromosomes are paired with the subsequent 
selection of the chromosome with the best fit. A 
deterministic choice is made with a probability of  
2%. Subgroups are 2 individuals in size. 
A new population is being formed, which 
consists of chromosomes obtained as a result of the 
application of genetic operators to the chromosomes 
of the parent population. The new population 
becomes current for this iteration of the genetic 
algorithm. 
 
3. Crossover 
The crossover is applied to a pair of 
chromosomes from the parent population. As a result 
of their recombination, a new generation is obtained. 
Further, for each pair of parents, a random gene 
position is determined as a crossing point in the 
chromosom 
 
Figure 3: Scheme illustrating the tournament 
selection method for subgroups 
 
A study was carried out on the example of 
ontology integration: information systems for 
managing the educational process and information 
systems for financial planning, as well as 
information systems ""Progress"" and information 
systems for managing the educational process, 
information systems ""Auditorium"" and information 
systems ""Schedule"". As a result of computational 
experiments, the most efficient genetic operators and 
parameters were determined. The analysis of the 
results obtained showed that GA gives the best result 
when using several crossover operators: 30% single-
point crossover, 40% arithmetic crossover and 30% 
two-point crossover. 
 
4. Mutation 
In each new chromosome, a gene is randomly 
selected and mutated. The probability of a gene 
mutation is very small (~ 1-2%). All duplicate 
chromosomes are removed from the population. 
The two-point mutation operator changes the 
value of two genes from 𝑡, 𝑟 or 𝑎 in the chromosome 
to random numbers in the range [0,1] subject to the 
following constraint 𝑡 � 𝑟 � 𝑎 � 1.

5. Assessment of the fitness of chromosomes in 
a population 
At each iteration, the values of the fitness 
function are calculated for all chromosomes of the 
current population. 
 
6. Checking the condition for stopping the 
algorithm 
The algorithm stops if the following condition is 
met: �𝑓�,�,�� � 𝑓�,�,����� � 1.0𝐸 � 6 
Another condition for stopping the genetic 
algorithm is a given execution time or a certain 
number of iterations. 
 
7. Choosing the ""best"" solution 
The result is recorded as a chromosome. It is 
chosen with the smallest value of the fitness 
function, otherwise we proceed to the next step - 
selection. 
The block diagram of the algorithm is shown in 
Figure 4. In order to improve the efficiency of the 
use of genetic operators, the standard genetic 
algorithm has been modified. A number of genetic 
operators were included in the GA: selection, 30% 
one-point crossing over, 40% arithmetic crossing 
over, and 30% two-point; random mutation. 
Below is an example of how crossover operators 
work. 
Single point crossover:  
Х.-father: t1 | r1, a1 Х.-mother: t2 | r2, a2 Х.-
descendant: t1 | r2, a2 or t2 | r1, a1  
Point-to-point crossover: 
Х.- father: t1 | r1| a1 Х.- mother: t2 | r2| a2 Х.- 
descendant: t2 | r1|a2 or t1 | r2| a1  
Arithmetic point crossover: 
Х.- father: t1, r1, a1 Х.- mother: t2, r2, a2 Х.- 
descendant: 
w×t1 +(1-w)×t2, w×r1 +(1-w)×t2, w×a1 +(1-
w)×a2 
or 
w×t2 +(1-w)×t1, w×r2 +(1-w)*t1, w×a2 +(1-
w)×a1 , 
where w – constant, random number from the 
interval [0,1].  
The use of a number of genetic operators identified 
in the experiment makes it possible to obtain a 
generation of individuals with the best value of the 
objective function and leads to an overall reduction 
in the time for solving the problem. 
 
Figure 4: Block diagram of the algorithm 
 
The assessment of the reliability of the results of 
the genetic algorithm was carried out for the case of 
finding the concepts ""Partially equivalent"" when 
integrating financial planning information systems 
and HR management information systems. To do 
this, let's analyze the absolute and relative error 
(𝐸𝑎𝑏𝑠, 𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙). 
𝐸𝑎𝑏𝑠 𝐾, 𝐾Э  � |𝐾 ∪ 𝐾Э| � |𝐾 ∩ 𝐾Э| 
𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝐾, 𝐾Э �  𝐸𝑎𝑏𝑠 𝐾, 𝐾Э/|𝐾Э|, 
where 𝐾Э - set of initial partially equivalent concepts 
obtained by an expert, 𝐾Э �  57; 
𝐾 - set of partially equivalent concepts found by 
the algorithm 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐾Э, 𝐾 � 42. 
As a result, the absolute error is 15, and the 
relative error is 0.26. 
The degree of coverage 𝑐𝑑 by a set of partially 
equivalent concepts of the set of initial ones. For the 
set of found concepts, it is equal to 𝑐𝑑 � 1 � 𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙 �
0.74. It follows from this that the reliability of the 
found partially equivalent concepts is quite high. 
A comparative analysis with the brute force 
method and the gradient descent method is carried 
out. When using the enumeration method with an 
increase in the number of concepts in the ontology, 
the number of solution options increases. The 
gradient 
descent 
method 
is 
based 
on 
the 
determination of the local maximum by choosing 
some random values of the parameters. By changing 
the values of these parameters, you can achieve the 
highest growth rate of the objective function. If the 
maximum is reached, then such an algorithm stops. 
Finding the global optimum will require additional 
efforts. This method does not guarantee the 
optimality of the found solution. As a result of the 
analysis, it was revealed that the proposed genetic

algorithm has accelerated convergence and shows 
the best end result. 
 
2.5 Classification of levels of proximity of 
concepts 
 
The method for calculating the semantic 
proximity of concepts allows you to quantify the 
similarity between concepts. For each concept of one 
ontology, a set of relevant semantic concepts of 
another ontology is formed. In order to rank the 
elements of the result set, it is necessary to determine 
the threshold values of the proximity measure. 
A method has been developed for classifying the 
levels of proximity of concepts to establish their 
correct display (Figure 5). 
The question of finding the minimum threshold 
𝑏 of semantic proximity at which the concepts are 
assumed to be equivalent is considered. 
 
𝑏 � 𝑚𝑎𝑥�𝑆�𝑐�, 𝑐��|∀𝑐� ∈ 𝑂�, ∀𝑐� ∈ 𝑂� ∗ 𝑝�/100 
 (16) 
  
where 𝑝1 – percentage at which 𝑏 is taken as a 
similarity threshold for establishing equivalence and 
correct display 𝑐𝑖 and 𝑐𝑗. 
It is shown that 𝑏 is the minimum threshold at 
which a decrease in this value leads to the 
impossibility of a complete display of ontology 
elements.  
A threshold value is found at which the concepts 
are assumed to be partially equivalent. 
 
𝑞 � 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑆 𝑐�, 𝑐�∀𝑐� ∈ 𝑂�, ∀𝑐� ∈ 𝑂� ∗ 𝑝�/100 (17) 
  
where 𝑝2 –the percentage at which 𝑞 is accepted as 
the similarity threshold for establishing partial 
equivalence of concepts.  
It is shown that 𝑞 is the minimum value in the 
sense that a decrease in this value leads to an 
incorrect display of ontology elements.  
Concepts are accepted different if semantic 
closeness measures not exceeding the threshold 𝑞 are 
important. 
 
Figure 5: Method of classification of levels of semantic 
similarity of concepts 
 
Thus, it is possible to construct a model of a 
single integrated information space based on the 
ontologies of information systems of different 
subject areas, which is a unified entry point for 
information from systems and data sources into a 
single information space. 
The constructed model of a single integrated 
information space reflects information systems in 
the best way. The constructed model serves as a basis 
for determining semantic dependencies, and also 
makes it possible to apply the technology of 
integrating data from information systems of 
different subject areas. 
The result of mathematical modeling is the 
construction of a model for the integration of 
information systems, as well as proof of its 
compliance with the set research goal. The 
applicability of the model was investigated when 
integrating systems of different subject areas of the 
university. According to the analysis of the obtained 
results, the constructed model of information 
systems integration is capable of adequately 
describing the initial situation. The integration 
algorithm using ontologies as a whole is free from 
many disadvantages inherent in purely technical 
methods, and provides an opportunity to develop 
integrated information systems that work with 
information at the semantic level.

systems based on ontologies

constructed

model 
for 
displaying and integrating information systems

integration of the generic hierarchy, starting from the 
root of the hierarchical tree. This task, in turn, is 
convenient to perform recursively: integrate the root 
of the hierarchy (the incoming concept) into the base 
hierarchy (also specified by its root - the input 
parameter) and the subtrees of each of the 
subordinate concepts of this concept by calling the 
same procedure with the current subordinate concept 
of this concept as the top of the hierarchy. For the 
possibility of recursive treatment, this part of the 
system integration algorithm is separated into a 
separate procedure. 
Integration of the concepts of the initial 
ontologies consists in placing the given concept of 
the integrated ontology into the hierarchy of the 
basic ontology. The general scheme of the algorithm 
operation is to insert an integrable class of concepts 
into the base hierarchy at the lowest possible level. 
Walking down the hierarchy is implemented 
recursively. 
Using the constructed model and the method for 
assessing the semantic proximity of ontology 
concepts, as a result of a computational experiment, 
an information system integration algorithm was 
developed, which can be divided into six stages 
(Figure 6): 
1. Comparison of ontologies. 
A selection of the initial ontologies 𝑂 and 𝑂� of 
integrable information systems is performed. It is 
assumed that 𝑂 is the basic, basic ontology and 𝑂� is 
the integrable ontology. Weights are calculated for 
measures of semantic proximity of concepts, as well 
as threshold values for classifying relationships 
between concepts 𝐶. 
2. Integration of concepts. 
Step 1. The set 𝐶�
� of subordinate concepts with 
the root vertex 𝐶� of the basic ontology 𝑂 and the set 
𝐶�
�  of subordinate concepts from the root 𝐶� of the 
basic ontology 𝑂 and the set 𝐶�
�  of the integrable 
ontology 𝑂 are formed. 
Step 2. Beginning of the cycle. The cycle 
compares and integrates the elements of the set 
𝐶�
� with the elements of the set 𝐶�
�, i.e. a concept from 
the set 𝐶�
� is integrated with the concept-vertex 𝐶� in 
the ontology hierarchy. 
Step 3. The measure of semantic similarity is 
calculated for concepts from the set 𝐶�
�  and concepts 
from the set 𝐶�
�. 
Step 4. In accordance with the threshold values 
of the proximity measure, the type of semantic 
dependence between the concepts is determined and 
either a mapping is established or a conflict 
resolution algorithm is performed. The loop is 
executed until all elements of the set 𝐶� have been 
analyzed. 
If dependencies 𝑧�, 𝑧� are found, then the 
concept mapping is set automatically. If the 
dependences 
𝑧�, 𝑧�, 𝑧� 
are 
found, 
then 
the 
correctness of the constructed mapping is confirmed 
manually. 
3. Checking the result. Checking the correctness 
of the resulting ontology. 
4. Interpretation. Derivation of the resulting 
mappings between concepts and attributes of 
information systems ontologies. 
5. Iteration. Repetition of some steps of the 
algorithm. 
6. Establishment of mappings between the 
elements of object schemes of information systems 
based on the connection of ontological concepts. 
After that, it becomes possible to generate requests 
for adding information from one information system 
to another. 
At the first stage of the algorithm, variants of the 
mutual relationship of concepts are taken into 
account. The result of the operation of their 
comparison leads to five different operations on 
concepts. 
 
 
Figure 6: The process of integrating information 
systems 
 
1. If the concepts are equivalent, then they 
represent the same concept in the ontology, 
therefore, must be ""glued"" into one. 
2. If the concept of one ontology is a 
generalization of the corresponding concept of 
another ontology, such concepts should be 
represented as a concept and a subclass, respectively, 
and the matching attributes should be removed from 
the subclass, since they will be inherited from the 
output

to take into account all the existing relationships of 
these concepts. 
4. If the concepts of two ontologies are partially 
equivalent, then they represent similar concepts, that 
is, they must have a common superclass, which is 
their generalization (note that this superclass was not 
present in any of the original ontologies), while the 
matching attributes must be removed from the 
subclass since they will be inherited from the generic 
concept.  
5. One ontology may lack an equivalent concept 
from another ontology. The situation when the 
measure of proximity of concepts is less than the 
threshold at which it can be considered that the 
concept is absent in the original ontology. In this 
case, measures of semantic closeness between the 
given concept and all the concepts of the original 
ontology are calculated. Concepts are selected for 
which the measure of proximity S is maximal, and 
the mapping into the resulting ontology is set. If the 
condition is met, then the concept is copied into the 
resulting ontology with attributes and relationships 
as a subclass of the concept that has a mapping. 
After building the resulting ontology of 
information systems, it becomes possible to interpret 
information from one information system by means 
of another information system. 
The result of mathematical modeling in this 
article is the construction of a model for the 
integration of information systems. 
The constructed models of integration of 
information systems are able to adequately describe 
the initial situation. The integration algorithm using 
ontologies as a whole is free from many of the 
drawbacks inherent in purely technical methods, and 
provides an opportunity for the development of 
integrated information systems that work with 
information at the semantic level. 
3. CONCLUSION 
The study received a mathematical model of 
integration 
of 
information 
systems 
with 
heterogeneous 
ontological 
specifications 
that 
analyzes the semantic connections arising between 
similar elements ontology information systems 
integrable. 
As well as a computational method for 
determining the semantic proximity of concepts has 
been developed, as well as a method for classifying 
the levels of their proximity in order to build a 
resulting (integrated) ontology. 
Also, a genetic algorithm is proposed that has 
accelerated convergence and shows the best end 
result. 
Scope of the results obtained: 
- to implement an on-demand data integration 
approach when there are no special hardware 
requirements; 
- for cases when the problem of access to fresh 
data becomes more urgent than the systematization 
of already accumulated data; 
- in the process of the IAIS development, if there 
is a need to change the schemes, data models of the 
integrated subsystems. 
The results obtained can be applied to implement 
an approach to data integration on demand.

","  today is difficult to imagine without integrated automated information systems (iais) that support various business processes. obtaining aggregated information for the purpose of making management decisions depends on the effective interaction of information systems (is) included in the structure of the iais. business processes are often automated using software solutions of its own and third-party developers, regardless of their interconnectedness, which is especially true for universities. with constant changes in these business processes, iais developers are forced to adjust programs and data models, which leads to structural and semantic heterogeneity of information elements and, accordingly, the need to re-develop software data converters. the use of such solutions leads to complication and, consequently, a decrease in the reliability of the iais.  this article continues the series of publications [25-27], which includes the problem of building integrated automated information systems that support various business processes based on ontologies. the purpose of the article is to develop a mathematical model, algorithm and software system for integrating is data based on the application of the ontological approach. to achieve this goal, the following tasks were set. 1. build a mathematical model of data integration of information systems with heterogeneous ontological specifications. 2. to develop a computational method for evaluating the semantic proximity of concepts (elements) of heterogeneous ontologies.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
New technologies in education, like in any sphere of our life, 
have a significant effect on the core processes, including the 
interaction of teachers and students in the context of the transfer 
of knowledge. In this field, educational software gains 
popularity [1]. Areas of application of such systems, as well as 
courses, where they are used, are varied. For example, in the 
process of teaching physics such training systems are 
implemented as virtual physical laboratories for experiments 
simulation [2]. The authors of the article develop such virtual 
laboratories that are used in teaching physics for students of the 
International Information Technology University (Kazakhstan, 
Almaty) of all the academic programs. These laboratories 
include stand along laboratory works that help to conduct 
physical experiments, and simple animations that help to 
visualize various physical phenomena from different sections of 
general physics course for students of technical academic 
programs. The technologies used for the implementation of 
these applications vary as well. Game engines, as well as 
technologies of augmented and virtual reality are employed 
within the development process. The presented article is devoted 
to the development of such applications that allow performing 
virtual physical experiments; these programs are based on a 
game engine.  
Among the examples of such computer-based educational 
programs the following applications can be distinguished. 
LabinApp organization uses modern technology for the 
benefit of education [3]. They create software using 3D graphics, 
which helps people to interact, visualize and study the science. 
Today they have developed 4 laboratories in two subjects: 
physics and biology. In each program, users can conduct 
experiments to study the object interactively, with detailed 
visualization. 
Newton programs are the virtual physical laboratories, 
presented in the form of software [4]. These developments make 
it possible to study the kinematics, dynamics, thermodynamics, 
optics and other fields of physics using a single computer. The 
whole process of experiments is controlled by a user. He/she 
assembles mechanisms, gradually watching the process on 
auxiliary video. 
Virtual Star Laboratories – is a project of MIT 
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology), which was created to 
develop laboratories for research and training [5]. Its main 
function is to develop training and research applications in 
biology, genetics, hydrology and others. 
NASA has used the Unity 3D to simulate the solar system 
and the objects within a project Eyes on the Earth [6]. There is 
also a realistic astronomical simulator Universal sandbox, where 
you can observe the interaction between the various celestial 
bodies, based on physical laws [7]. 
The company FX Palo Alto used Unity3D to create 3D 
models of the chocolate factory. A user is able to monitor all the 
processes occurring in the production in real-time [8]. 
MIT Media group used Unity3D for the similar purpose, as 
well as to accelerate the visual analysis of the information they 
put into the 3D space created by them [9]. 
The experimental psychologist and engineer of the human 
interface developed Virtual Game Lab, which helps to solve the 
problems of people with various mental diseases, to study 
cognitive abilities, behavior of humans [10]. 
II.
RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF A GAME ENGINE
Recently many powerful game engines have become 
available for general use. Thus, using them, it is possible for 
independent developers to visualize the reality they want more 
accurately. Unity, UDK, Cry ENGINE, Torque 2D/3D and 
HeroEngine (special MMO-engine) are the most popular game 
engines. Each of them is powerful software with specific 
strengths. 
Unity is a game engine with a wide range of possibilities and 
a friendly user interface. The main distinguishing feature of this 
engine is that Unity is multiplatform. It allows easy and quick

porting of games to such platforms as Android, iOS, Windows 
Phone 8 and BlackBerry. This feature makes Unity foreground 
while choosing the software for mobile games development 
[11]. 
Unreal Development Kit (UDK) is a free version of Unreal 
Engine 3. It is created by Epic Games and used for the AAA 
games development, including Gears of War shooter game. 
UDK has excellent graphics capabilities and can be used for the 
mobile games development. Unlike Unity, UDK has its own 
powerful tool directly in the engine for the game levels design 
[12]. 
CryENGINE is an extremely powerful game engine, created 
by Crytek Company and first introduced in Far Cry version 1. 
This engine allows designing games for PC and consoles like 
PS4 and Xbox One. The graphic features of CryENGINE are 
significantly superior to that of the first two engines, because 
they include art house light, realistic physics, advanced 
animation and others. CryENGINE was used to develop Ryse: 
Son of Rome. Like UDK, this engine is highly intuitive and has 
powerful features for the levels design [13].  
Torque 2D/3D is a cross platform game engine with the code 
implemented in C++ and C#. It is fully equipped with special 
tools and an interface for applications and games development. 
Using Torque 2D/3D it is possible to create projects for Web. It 
has its own script language TorqueScript. For the visualization 
purposes OpenGL is used in the 2D engine version and DirectX 
– in 3D version [14].  
HeroEngine is a 3D engine created for MMO games. It has 
its own programming language HeroScript and it is possible to 
use C++. The scripts in HeroScript run faster than Python 
programs, therefore, all game actions and events handling are 
implemented in HeroScript. HeroEngine suggests visualization 
in DirectX 9.0c and supports a large number of technologies, 
like PhysX, FaceGen, FMod, SpeedTree and others. It is 
possible to develop an application on-line [15]. 
After the examination of the available engines the Unity 3D 
was chosen. Apart from the fact that it is easy to use, the engine 
meets all the requirements of the authors, such as availability of 
sources of information and user manuals, as well as graphical 
capabilities.  
III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF AN EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE 
According to the work done, a piece of educational software 
for physics study was developed. This program includes the 
implementation of laboratory works on the following topics: 
1) Diffraction of electrons; 
2) Determination of the coefficient of viscosity of liquids by 
the Stokes method; 
3) Measure the speed of a bullet; 
4) Verification of the Malus law and the study of elliptically 
polarized light. 
Each of the above laboratory works has a pleasant and 
convenient interface that allows students to easily manage the 
program. The functionality of each virtual laboratory work 
meets the requirements of real experiments. Users can adjust 
the virtual equipment and set the initial values of input 
parameters. The results of the conducted experiments can be 
exported to a text file for further calculations, analysis and 
conclusions.  
The following distinguishing features of the developed 
applications compared to the existing analogs can be identified.  
First, the authors have chosen the physical experiments to 
create software for from the various fields of general physics 
course according to the model curriculum. It is provided by the 
State Educational Standard, which suggests the content of 
compulsory courses for all the academic programs in 
Kazakhstan. Physics is the mandatory course for all the 
technical academic programs. In such a way, the developed 
applications can be used in teaching physics for students of any 
technical major in Kazakhstan. 
Second, a user of the developed virtual laboratory works can 
choose the most familiar language for him/her, namely Kazakh, 
Russian or English. The user interface as well as 
methodological guidance for performing experiments is 
provided in these three languages, since all of them are used as 
languages of courses delivery in Kazakhstani universities.  
Figure 1 shows the menu of the main window of the 
developed application.  
 
 
Fig. 1. Main application menu. 
The entire set of programs was implemented using the game 
engine Unity 3D and 3D Blender editor. The functionality of 
laboratories is written in the programming language C#. 
Blender allows creating a wide variety of models, and C# helps 
to recreate their behavior in a real environment in virtual space. 
Unity 3D combines these elements into a single whole. All 
elements of the application are shown in Fig. 2 and combined 
in a component diagram. In order to start the execution of any 
of the laboratory work, a user needs to run the program and 
click the ""Laboratories"" button. Then he/she can choose one of 
the 4 available experiments. In accordance with the selected 
task, the start scene will open. Demonstration of the scenes that 
correspond to the virtual laboratory works is shown in Fig. 3-6.  
Each experiment of this software complex is not only virtual 
laboratory work, but also methodical material, which describes 
in detail all the stages of the task. Due to this, the user can 
perform the experiment without assistance. This, in its turn, will 
help to remember better the studied physical processes and laws. 
To control the application user-familiar keyboard buttons 
are used, the mouse is used to change the camera's view. Every 
move inside the application is intuitive and does not require 
special skills or knowledge.

In order to help the user to perform the task, in addition to the 
methodical material available in application, during the 
laboratory work prompts are shown on the screen as it is 
depicted in Fig. 3. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Determination of the coefficient of viscosity of liquids by the Stokes 
method. 
Depending on the task, the equipment and the view of the 
scene as a whole change. For example, in the tasks 
«Determination of the coefficient of viscosity of liquids by the 
Stokes method» (Fig. 5) and «Verification of the Malus law and 
the study of elliptically polarized light» (Fig. 6), tables that are 
filled in during the experiments are displayed. In addition, in 
the laboratory works users can set the initial values of input 
parameters. For example, it is possible to choose the bullet 
caliber before measuring its speed. During the determination of 
the liquids viscosity coefficient it is possible to choose the 
material of the ball that falls in to liquid. And depending on the 
initial parameters the visualization of the experiments changes.

For instance it is can be visually observed that the iron ball 
reaches the bottom of the vessel quicker than the marble one.

IV.
CONCLUSION 
Thus, each element of this software complex allows not 
only to observe the flow of the physical phenomenon, but also 
to conduct one’s own experiments with obtaining certain 
parameters that correspond to real indicators. In this case, the 
execution of the experiment in a virtual environment is much 
easier and faster. The assimilation of material under such an 
approach is also higher due to greater involvement in the 
process and the game form of the presentation of the material 
being studied.

Abstract 
Recent technological advances have enabled the emergence of novel business models based on platforms. This paper aims to 
contribute to design platforms of business process (BP), by studying the new and specific context of platform to improve the model 
of platform technology for creating automated system (AS) for BP. Our approach is provides an algorithm to build such a 
component and enrich future systems. A specific objective is to elicit detailed platform’s requirements and features for this 
particular context. The structure recommendations are determined for business process can bolster various sorts of generative 
instruments of social communication: data sharing, combination, and aggregate activity. The knowledge generated in this study 
extends the limits of automated planning of business process, adds more scientific thoroughness for AS with regards to business 
process the executives and adds to control stream design hypothesis.

1. Introduction 
In today's e-world, where companies and organizations carry out most of their business over the internet, software 
architectures attempt to deal with the increasing levels of complexity. As the level of complexity continues to ascend, 
traditional architectures do not seem to be capable of dealing with the current problems such as the need to respond 
quickly to new requirements and allow better and faster integration of applications in platform [1-2].

platform coincides with the technology of creating the AS. Developers of platform mostly focused on single design 
parameters that give users a good reason to join and keep using the platform: notably, the creation of new features and 
add-ons that attract users [3]. In our case the platform development is carried out in this way. When examining a 
problem area, it is necessary to establish the directions in the series of the problem area that are most unstable or 
changeable in different instances of the problem area class. Services are created to take account the individual 
characteristics of the instances. Then the process of building an automation system for individual instances of a 
problem area based on platforms is reduced to combining the software (small integration) of the platform with the 
necessary services. 
The following is a definition of common properties or parameters for all instances of the problem area. Based on 
the general properties of the problem area, the core of the platform should be built [4]. Based on our findings, we will 
sketch a guiding an algorithm for creating an automated system based on platform of business process. 
2. Algorithm for creating platform based systems 
The process of creating a system by the platform begins according to the requests submitted to the platform by the 
actor (s), which includes the terms of reference. According to the application received, a feature vector is determined 
that characterizes the future system being created. The signs of the future system are contained in the application or 
they are formed by the platform during the processing of the application (see Fig. 1). 
Thus, the application consists of sections: tasks for creating a class of BPMS systems, technical task, feature vector. 
The application task section contains information about which system should be built - this acts as a goal, signs are 
needed to assess the complexity and cost of the future system. The technical task section contains data on what 
functional qualities from the point of view of system consumers, i.e. user requirements must be met. Preliminary work 
on this can be found in [5-6] 
At the platform application level, by a feature vector, a system similar in features is searched. If there is no such 
model, then the system metamodel is built in the core. 
After receiving the application, the next step is searching among applications recorded and stored systems for a 
system that meets the requirements of the application. It is pre-formalized by a set of features and the systems are also 
formalized by features. If the conditions for equality are fulfilled for the relevant features, then it is considered that the 
system is found that satisfies the requirements of the applications. If no finished system is found, then it is necessary 
to build a system for applications. To do this, in the core of the platform for the business process (based on the business 
process) we will build a system that reflects the logic of the system’s action on BPMN / BPEL. Then, for the BPEL 
service nodes, we define the WSDL of the services. For one business process, we will build one BPEL model and 
service. 
Then the type of business process is determined, highlight business processes and determine their boundaries. 
Because business processes are an integrating tool of all production elements (components) necessary to achieve a 
goal or its purpose. Both the verification of business processes and the definition of business processes are based on a 
semantic analysis of the application submitted. 
Next, it is necessary to formulate the tasks of automating business processes taking into account their parameters 
and components. Based on the results of the analysis of applications, solutions will be selected by templates, i.e. 
selection of the necessary features for each specialized process. The process template consists of the logical part and 
set of services that are performed depending on the execution conditions for the parameters characterizing the 
characteristics of the subject, the means of labor, as well as the production environment, which are presented as part 
of the ontological environment model and are part of the EPI. 
The next step is the formation of the logic of a specialized process, and then the logic of the complete process. 
The formation of the logic of specialized processes as part of a business process is carried out in the following 
sequence: administrative, organizational, managerial, technological, providing resources, service based on UDDi. 
Next-to-last stage is the calculation of the plan and schedule using services. 
As a result, we obtain in the form of an answer the sequence of ordered business operations that we need and the 
parameter values are determined. 
An expanded view of the business process model can be achieved based on the multidimensional concept of 
business processes

The functioning of the platform is based on a specific model of representing business processes. Therefore, it is 
necessary to consider and analyze the features of the model for representing the business processes themselves.

3. Transfer of experience in automating business processes under variable conditions  
The dynamism of the world posed new challenges for transferring experience in automating business processes to 
new conditions (i.e., induction), in particular [8-9]: 
• under variable design conditions (goals, criteria for doing business, etc.); 
• for new copies of the same problem area; 
• for instances of new problem areas. 
Consider ways to solve the following problem, where IP are sets of problem areas that will be called classes. IPj is 
a problem area with the identifier ""j"" or the j-th class.  
Let subclasses or instances Ej = {Eih}, h = 1, mi of each problem area IPj be given. 
If the instance Eih of the problem area IPj has the automation system АSih then this instance is called the base or 
main instance of the problem area IPj. 
Let mj instances Ej = {Eih}, h = 1, mi of the same class “problem area” IPj be given. Among them, a copy of Eih is 
core or basic, since for which the automation system АSih was created. 
Task requirements: you need to create an АSik for an instance Eik of the problem area IPj.  Let's look at a few cases.

Case №1 
The first wording of the condition. Let L(Eik) be the novelty level of the k-th instance of the problem region IPj 
equally with the novelty level L(Eih) of the main instance of the problem region IPj for which АSih was created, i.e. ΔS 
= L(Eik) - L(Eih) ≅ 0 or ΔS = |L(Eik) - L(Eih)| < Δ1 
The second wording of the condition. Suppose that for LK(Eik)  the level of difference between the project situations 
of the k-th instance of the problem area IPj  and the project situations LK(Eih)  is basically the h-th instance of the 
problem area IPj for which АSih  is created, conditions LK(Eik) < Δ1 are satisfied. 
Decision. In this case, the solution is to replicate АSih of the main instance of the problem area for the k-th instance 
of the problem area IPj. 
This paper does not reveal the formula for calculating the expression: LK(Eih), L(Eik), LK(Eik), LK(Eih), ΔS = L(Eik) 
- L(Eih) ≅ 0, LK(Eik) ≅ 0.  
Case №2 
The first wording of the condition. Let L(Eik) be the novelty level of the k-th instance of the problem region IPj 
equally with the novelty level L(Eih) of the main instance of the problem region IPj for which АSih was created, i.e. 
Δ1 < ΔS = L(Eik) - L(Eih) < Δ2 or Δ1 < ΔS = |L(Eik) - L(Eih)| < Δ2. 
The second wording of the condition. Suppose that for LK(Eik) the level of difference between the project situations 
of the k-th instance of the problem area IPj and the project situations LK(Eih) is basically the h-th instance of the 
problem area IPj, for which АSih is created, the conditions Δ1 < LK(Eik) < Δ2  
Decision. In this case, the solution is to customizing АSih of the main instance of the problem area for the k-th 
instance of the problem area IPj. 
This paper does not reveal the formula for calculating the expression: LK(Eih), L(Eik), LK(Eik), LK(Eih), ΔS = L(Eik) 
- L(Eih) ≅ 0, LK(Eik) ≅ 0.  
Case №3 
The first wording of the condition. Let L(Eik) be the novelty level of the k-th instance of the problem region IPj 
equally with the novelty level L(Eih) of the main instance of the problem region IPj for which АSih was created, i.e. 
Δ2 < ΔS = L(Eik) - L(Eih) < Δ3 или Δ2 < ΔS = |L(Eik) - L(Eih| < Δ3. 
The second wording of the condition. Suppose that for LK(Eik) the level of difference between the project situations 
of the k-th instance of the problem area IPj and the project situations LK(Eih) is basically the h-th instance of the 
problem area IPj, for which АSih is created, the conditions Δ2 < LK(Eik) < Δ3. 
Decision. In this case, the solution is to create AS based on the platform, taking as АSih the main instance of the 
problem area for the k-th instance of the problem area IPj 
This paper does not reveal the formula for calculating the expression: LK(Eih), L(Eik), LK(Eik), LK(Eih), ΔS = 
L(Eik) - L(Eih) ≅ 0, LK(Eik) ≅ 0.  
Case №4 
Suppose there are “problem areas”: IP = {IPj}, where IP are sets of problem areas that will be called classes; IPj is 
the problem area with the identifier ""j"" or the j-th class, IPq is the problem area with the identifier ""q"" or the q -th class. 
Let the problem region IPj have instances EJ = {Eih}, h = 1, mi and let the problem region IPq have instances Eq 
= {Eqf}, f = 1, mq  
The Eih instance of the IPj problem area has an АSih automation system, but not one instance of the IPq problem 
area has an automation system. 
Task requirements: it is required to create АS qf for the f-th instance Eqf ∈ Eq of the problem area IPq. 
Decision. In this case, the solution is to create АСqf for the f-th instance of the IPq problem area from scratch without 
using the АSih creation experience. 
In all cases, design is carried out under the condition that the design or production environment belongs to the same 
class and is characterized in a general way as follows. 
At time t, the production situation for the business process is determined or set in this way: 
 
SP (t) = <Z (t), Jb (t), Sl (t), EP (t), BP (t)>, 
 
 
 
(1) 
Where: 
• SP (t) - production situation arising before the business process and its automation, 
• Z (t) - the purpose or purpose of the business process,

Uskenbayeva R.K. et al../ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–000

• Jb (t) - task at the current time, 
• Sl (t) - the subject of labor at the current time, 
• EP (t) - factors and environmental objects that directly affect the implementation of the business process (means 
of transportation), 
• BP (t) - the state of the business process, characterized by the values of the indicators of the business process. 
4. Technology for creating an automated system based on a platform for automating a business process 
The establishment of business operations in the “as-is” chart is required to be used for a pre-project survey of the 
methodology process and the use of the following tools [10]: 
• IDEF0 - functional modeling methodology 
• IDEF3 - process description methodology 
• DFD - data flow modeling methodology 
• IDEF1X - data modeling methodology. 
If the platform is built on the upper hierarchical level, then the services should be more complete, heavy and vice 
versa. The result of the process description is presented in the form of diagrams as is. The declarative presentation of 
the diagram is a paradigm and it expresses the logic of work without a description of their management. This is the as-
is chart. 
 Depth of detail operations, i.e. hierarchy levels can be as many as feedback loops of the multi-loop operation itself. 
But hierarchy is presented at three levels. At the top level, only a sequence of operations is specified. This can be done 
with an IDEF3 chart. At the second level, the composition of operations and the feedback loop are revealed. The third 
and further levels are further details of business operations. There are contradictions between the selected operations 
in the form of a diagram as is and the selected services. The deeper the operations stand out (diagrams as they are), 
the service requirements are weakened. The level of detail depends on the level of granularity of services to solve the 
automation task of this business process. 
The given cases of applying the methods of using experience are immeasurable. Therefore, measurable methods of 
problematicity are given. 
Case №1 
Platform design since Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 0, Vs (3) = 0. 
Where Vs (i) = 1 if the i-th level of the as-is diagram is the same. Define diagrams of 2nd and 3rd levels. Platform 
design required. Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 0, Vs (3) = 0. Where Vs (i) = 1 if the i-th level of the as-is diagram matches the 
diagram of the current subject space. In this case, the designation means that Vs (1) = 1 - the diagram of the 1st level 
coincides, the diagrams of the 2nd and 3rd levels do not coincide. 
The built platform at this level will be universal, but less effective. At this level, BPEL is more granular (you can 
enable services in the form of systems and integrate them. For example, a reporting platform), so you need to increase 
the service. Make them flexible. 
Case №2 
Customization Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 1, Vs (3) = 0. Customization of specialized processes: organization, 
management. 
Customization is required since Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 1, Vs (3) = 0. It is necessary to configure specialized processes: 
organization, management. 
The built platform at this level will be less universal, but more effective. 
Case №3 
Replication  Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 1, Vs (3) = 1. Service tincture 
Replication required since Vs (1) = 1, Vs (2) = 1, Vs (3) = 1. Need tincture of services. 
Case №4 
Decomposition of each business transaction, taking into account or following (in contrast to IDEF0) the sequence 
of their execution. This is achieved by the fact that it is not the first level that defines the relationship, but at the 
subsequent stage each business operation is individually decomposed. 
Each business transaction is identified by coordinates (X, Y, Z, F,), where X is the ordinate axis, Y is the abscissa 
axis, Z is the level number, F is the depth number.

If the as-is process diagram simply corresponds to a process or technological process consisting of technological 
operations, then the to-be diagram corresponds to a business process. 
Thus, the design of the diagram as it should be “to-be” corresponds to the formation of a business process and, 
accordingly, the design of an automation system for a given business process. 
Imperative presentation of diagrams is a paradigm that uses statements that change the state of the world. This is 
the to-be diagram. 
Then the programming of the diagram as it should be “to-be” corresponds to the construction of software for a 
business process automation system. 
The process of constructing a diagram in the form in which it should be based on the models of business processes 
that have been proposed. 
These models are as follows [11-12]: 
1. The basic hierarchical model of the business process (see Fig. 2). 
2. The logical model of the business process options 
3. A model for ensuring observability and controllability 
 
 
 
Fig.2. Extended hierarchical structure (architecture) of the main (multidimensional, semantic, nonlinear) model of the business process, 
taking into account the logical model of BP 
 
The external conceptual model of the business process of a common problem area serves as a data / information 
transfer tool for processing procedures, sets or displays the characteristics of a business process for integration with 
external business processes and business process relationships, which displays the goals of a given supersystem at a 
macro level, information about your business process of a common problem area as an element of a single information 
space.

The internal conceptual model of the business process of the local problem area sets the information about the list 
of specialized processes included in the created business process of the local problem area, as well as the metamodel 
(description) of the integration of specialized processes within the business process for specific purposes within the 
problem area. 
The model is designed to automate business processes. Therefore, we will build the model for classes of business 
processes that are observable and manageable. This is achieved by introducing, first of all, the strategic process, which 
is the beginning of the management process. Therefore, for the managerial level, the specialized process, we introduce 
the strategic process from which we must begin. 
The logical model of a specialized process determines when and in what sequence processes are applied and 
executed. All these methods are the process of organization and management. The purpose of the logical model is to 
determine the sequence of business operations of each special process. Each business transaction consists of two parts: 
the operator and the procedure. Therefore, the logical model contains two levels. 
At the upper level, a specialized process is presented from a stack of specialized processes of a business process of 
a local problem area (for example, technological or organizational, or providing process resources) of one and the 
same special process and these operators follow them from operations. The choice is made based on the current 
situation (i.e., given the initial situation, the problem area). 
At the lower level, carries out a selection of procedures. 
The service model for managing an operator of a specialized process of a business process of a local problem area 
has two types of groups: 
- executive services; 
- managing service. 
The content of executive services depends on business operations. 
The set of services of one group of the specialized process of the local problem area has different signs of objects 
and means of labor, as well as signs of the working environment, i.e. single information space (EIP). All this constitutes 
an ontological model. 
The relationship is determined by the semantics of operations, i.e. first, the strategy determines the order of the 
main operator or process (or the main operators or processes), and then the sequence of operations and the 
connectedness of the operations of different specialized processes. 
The structure and architecture of the model, depending on the problem being solved, can be variable. 
According to the conceptual level: firstly, a different number of specialized processes, and secondly, at the logical 
level, a different composition of operations, i.e. may have a different content for each of them, depending on the need 
for the solution of which the business process is intended. As well as a different composition of internal processes. 
Thus, this general model of a business process is a configuration or a combination of separate local models. 
5. Conclusions and future work 
The present paper proposed an algorithm for constructing an automated system based on platforms that considers 
two approaches to building an automated system: 
The first approach is to build the platform to create a system based on the common properties of all instances of the 
problem area. Therefore, the development of the platform is based on common properties or parameters for all 
instances of the problem area. 
The second approach to building the platform comes down to building a complete system, which is based on a 
system adapted to alteration, as well as on a set of services reflecting the individual characteristics of individual 
instances of the problem area. 
In order to realize the platform in the future, it is essential to ensure the information progression between the 
different lifecycle stages between the different collaborators. Moreover, it is fundamental to clarify questions of 
information security and the authorized of data before it is possible to operate such a platform.

Abstract. The current work demonstrates the use of augmented reality tech-
nology for the development of an application that can be employed as an
additional teaching tool within physics in secondary educational institutions in
Kazakhstan. The application contains a set of problem tasks in “Mechanics”.
The physical processes within tasks are visualized with help of augmented
reality and this helps pupils to imagine and understand deeper the studied
phenomena. One of the advantages and distinctive features of the developed
application is that it provides the user interface in Kazakh, Russian and English
languages. This corresponds to the multilingual policy adopted by the govern-
ment of the country. In the article the existing analogs worldwide are presented,
development software is described and the main results of the project are
discussed.

Introduction
Nowadays, it is hard to think about modern education without employing information
and communication technologies (ICT) that evolves at a rapid pace. Not only higher,
but secondary and even primary educational institutions apply ICT within the educa-
tional process.
Today any teacher has many opportunities to use various ICT tools during classes,
such as the Internet, electronic books, dictionaries and directories, presentations,
software, communication means like chats, forums, blogs, electronic mail, telecon-
ferences, webinars and much more. Besides, application of ICT helps teachers to:
– continuously motivate pupils;
– activate cognitive abilities;
– attract passive pupils;
– accelerate educational process;
– provide up-to-date materials;
– teach pupils to work with different sources of information;

– promote research activities;
– provide ﬂexibility of education process.
Among the software for schools different types of virtual laboratories are worth to
be mentioned. They allow not only observing, but conducting virtual experiments of
various subjects [1]. Simple animations are also useful tools that can be used by pupils
for deeper understanding of studied processes and phenomena. And the augmented
reality (AR) is one of the technologies for developing such interactive applications.
They can be used by teachers within lessons as an additional tool for visualization of
the material explained.
The area of application of software with augmented reality involved is very wide.
For example, with help of such programs it is possible to conduct complex physical or
chemical experiments in real time absolutely safe. On the geography lesson the maps in
textbooks become “alive” and are able to move showing how countries’ boundaries or
population are changing in time. Also there is a chance to travel across the wonders of
the world sitting in class. It is possible to study historical battles or play a role of a
soldier. Descriptive video onto complex biological schemas can help understand and
remember studied material easily. In such countries like USA and Japan the lessons
with the use of augmented reality technology have been being conducted already for a
long time. The surveys show that as a result of such classes pupils are more involved
into the educational process and master new material easier.
In the article the authors present a computer application that allows solving a set of
practical tasks in physics, section “Mechanics”. The application is implemented using
the technology of augmented reality and is designed for secondary educational insti-
tutions. The application is developed at the Department of Computer Engineering and
Telecommunication of the International Information Technology University, Almaty,
Kazakhstan.

and Introduction of Computer Learning Systems
Based on the Augmented Reality
Modern technologies evolve very fast and nowadays the term “Augmented reality” is
not ﬁction. AR technology is able to change the notion of the modern world and make
it more convenient and interactive. The ﬁelds of application of this technology are quite
wide: medicine, warfare, education, public services, etc.
In the present article the use of augmented reality in education is shown. It is
generally known that human brain perceives visual images better, rather than just text.
A lot of research exists [2, 3], which shows that AR technology in education enriches
visual and contextual learning, improving the content of information. During lectures
only 25% of information is retained, but if visual support is used 80% of information
can be perceived. As a result of these studies, it turned out that application of aug-
mented reality in education is beneﬁcial for all people and for children especially.
Below several examples of foreign experience in using AR in education are
presented.
Development of Practical Tasks in Physics with Elements of Augmented Reality

In [4] the application of mobile augmented reality in teaching physics is shown.
The obtained results showed that the using of this technology by physics teachers is
rather effective. Besides, it allows developing skills to teach natural sciences in the
modern world of digital technologies.
In [5] the authors studied the problem of merging of their own devices and the
technology of augmented reality in education. It is shown that the use of this integration
allows increasing the quality of teaching of pupils and students in any institutions at
any level of education.
In [6] the application of AR technology in teaching natural sciences for pupils of 7th
grade of a private college was studied. According to the teachers and pupils opinion
studying the subjects with this technology was pleasant, easy and useful.
In [7] the use of AR technology in math studying and exactly in studying of solids
rotation was considered. The authors are convinced in advantages that AR technology
provides for math studying and intend to use it for explaining the calculations of
volume of rotation solids and other problems. In future the application of the tech-
nology will be widen in developing skills of spatial visualization.
The main idea in [8] is the investigation of the impact of AR on improving stu-
dents’ performance and their physiological state. The second year students took part in
the research. They studied the course “Presentation of information on computers” using
the AR technology and the Internet. The results showed that both technologies con-
tributed to improving of students’ performance.
The article [9] is about using AR technology to support “Software” course and to
test various studied effects with help of interactive on-line and AR teaching strategies.
The obtained results showed the potential of using AR methods for increasing students’
motivation and for interaction between peers. It was concluded that when introducing
of AR applications into the course, technology developers must carefully study the
teaching target audience, information volume depicted on the screen of mobile phone
and accessibility of training equipment and audience environment in order to archive
appropriate teaching scenarios.
In [10] the efﬁciency of using AR technology on lectures is shown. It is demon-
strated that AR has a positive effect on students learning process, increases their self-
esteem and motivation.
In such a way, training software with the use of AR technology is a promising tool
with completely new visualization possibilities.

Software Support of the Project
The main criteria for choosing the development tool for creating the application for
teaching physics with help of AR technology were speed of project development, the
quality of visualization and cheap cost.
3D graphics is used to display models, processes and phenomena. And as a
development tool Unity 3D was chosen.
Unity 3D is a cross-platform engine for the development of interactive application
with real-time graphics. This engine is most common among developers of 3D large-
scale games. It has its own editor; the programming language C# is used for the
406
Y. Daineko et al.
development. This allows creating applications that display complex physical pro-
cesses. The development process of 3D environments is object-oriented, which means
environment creation is divided into objects with behavior. The engine is implemented
using C++ language, and this fact makes it fast and productive.
The Unity 3D engine meets the following requirements:
– the end product is a multimedia 3D object, embedded into an HTML page;
– the end product is an object of high level of abstraction of object prototypes;
– high quality of graphical presentation of information;
– the library of 3D objects can work with many formats of modern 3D graphics, such
as *.3ds, *.dae, *.fbx, *.ﬂt;
– the support of high level languages (C++, C#, Java);
– the license for free use for non-commercial purposes;
– the editor for software and graphical objects development;
– the possibility to connect third-party object libraries.
The Vuforia library was chosen for the realization of augmented reality functions.
The library is cross-platform and free, it allows performing visual search. Vuforia
simpliﬁes scanning target object using the built-in scanner Vuforia Object Scanner.
Also it is possible to include virtual buttons and map additional elements with help of
OpenGL. The library is cross-platform, which means the application can be used on
any device. And the time for the development of the versions is minimal.
Free license decreases the cost of project realization, which is important factor
during the project implementation.
Also Vuforia allows creating various visual effects, like night vision or X-rays
simulation. Another useful feature of this library is that it is possible to play video on
any given surface. Occlusion control in Vuforia allows tracking objects even if they are
visible only partially.
Thus, Vuforia library provides all the necessary functionality and fully justiﬁes its
use in the project.

is developed. The tasks are realized with elements of augmented reality. The appli-
cation meets all the requirements for such type of systems, provides realization of large
number of complex effects; has simple but functional design and user-friendly
interface.
One of the distinctive features of the current application is its three-language
interface. A user is able to choose Kazakh, Russian or English language to interact with
the system. In Fig. 1 the main window of the application with English language
interface is shown.
The main idea of the current work is the development of animated tasks in physics
of school curriculum, which would be closest to the real world. The problem tasks for

the application were chosen in cooperation with the physics teacher of the Republican
Physics and Mathematics School (Almaty, Kazakhstan). The tasks are taken from the
pool of tasks for Olympiad in physics and require additional visual support for better
understanding. The problem visualization along with its given solution allows pupils to
understand thoroughly the physical nature of the studied processes and will facilitate
solving similar problems independently in future. Also the application allows pupils to
take part in the simulation, not only to passively observe it. He or she can change the
tasks parameters, and in such a way examine the process in different conditions. Thus,
visual demonstration of how the task elements depend on the physical parameters
makes the material easier to understand (Fig. 3).
Besides, the tasks are implemented with 3D scenes, so that experiments are shown
in space. A user can control an experiment by him/herself by modeling various situ-
ations of its conducting. For example, he/she is able to move in space of a task and
watch its simulation from any position or angle of view. It helps to perceive and
assimilate the material. A keyboard and a camera are used to control the simulation and
rotate the 3D scenes in different directions. Also it is possible to zoom out the objects
for more detailed observation. The dialog window is refreshed when a view point and
position are changed. The visual representation is the main advantage of the applica-
tion, which provides visibility and quick assimilation of the material. Moreover, in the
application it is possible to make mathematical calculations of experiments within
problem tasks.
Let us consider the problem task, which is presented in Fig. 2.
After a user has chosen the problem task above, its camera is turned on and needs to
be pointed on a special marker. A scene with problem task simulation will appear on
the screen (Fig. 3). At the beginning a stone and two textboxes appear. Using them it is
possible to set the velocity and the angle of the stone throw. The simulation changes
depending on these parameters.
After the parameters of the task are set, using the key U on the keyboard it is
possible to throw the stone. The directions of the velocity and stone gravitational force

are displayed using arrows on the next scene. Also the angle of the stone throw appears.
Since the solution of the problem is the time after which the stone reaches a certain
height, in the scene after the throw the points where this height is reached are marked
and the time is shown (Fig. 4). After the simulation using the keyboard it is possible to
proceed to the problem task solution.
The main feature of the developed application is visualization using augmented
reality. This approach makes pupils involved in experiments and the game form of the
application allows delivering material in a simple and easy way (Fig. 5). Besides, such
experiments will be much better mastered thanks to the interaction of the application
virtual elements and real physical objects.

In the application there is an access to the set of problem tasks from “Mechanics”
section so far. Currently 12 problem tasks are implemented. The problem tasks from
“Electricity” and “Optics” sections are under the development right now and will be
added to the application in the near future. New problem tasks can be easily integrated
into the application. All the tasks are taken from the physics course of a secondary
school curriculum. Each task contains an animated scene and a solution.
For each problem task a separate 3D model was created and a physical engine was
implemented. The engine calculates the interaction of the model’s objects. The models
were realized in Blender, and the main functionality is implemented in C#.

In Fig. 6 the component diagram of the application developed is displayed. All the
components can be divided into 3 groups: (1) starting point; (2) problem tasks – main
components; (3) additional components, which are problem tasks solutions. The main
project part is a set of 12 problem tasks. Each problem has an access to the shared
collection of 3D objects. Besides, all the problem tasks follow the common structure of
classes.

Conclusion
The efﬁciency of the developed application was estimated in the following way.
20 pupils of the 9th grade of the RFMW were interviewed. The question was “Is the
application with augmented reality effective supplementary learning tool to study
physics?”. The results of the interview are presented in the Table 1.

The interview shows that 89% of the respondents believe that the developed
application is effective and convenient in use. The pupils noted that such application
increase the interest in physics in general.
In such a way, new information technologies open wide perspectives for improving
the quality of education. Such technologies like Augmented Reality allow transforming
the process of solving traditional physical problem tasks into an interactive game. Thus,
pupils become more involved into the studied process. Such visualization helps in
understanding the problem and solving it. And as a long-term result pupils become
more motivated and interested in the subject in general.
The authors continue to work on the current project and develop new animated
problem tasks from other physics sections to be integrated into the application.

Abstract 
In this article, the problem of monitoring of climatic and ecological condition of the region is considered. The authors propose an 
approach to the construction of such systems using the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology. This will 
make it possible to create easily scalable low-cost systems with high energy efficiency through the use of modern communication 
technologies. During the experiment, the authors have identified certain patterns in collected data, such as dependence on the 
time of year, weather, and the location of certain industrial facilities near the observed zone.

Introduction 
Environmental pollution by enterprises and industrial vehicles, causing habitat degradation and damaging the 
health of the population, is the most acute problem of priority social and economic importance. Most of the air is 
poisoned by automobile exhausts, exhaust gases and power plants, and fires. 
The main air pollutants in the Republic of Kazakhstan are manufacturing enterprises, their share in the total 
volume of emissions is 50%, enterprises for the production and distribution of electricity, gas and water 28%, mining 
enterprises occupy 14% of the total structure, the remaining industries account for about 8%. At the same time, air

pollution is associated with emissions from non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy enterprises, thermal power 
engineering, and the oil and gas complex. At present, on average, in the Republic of Kazakhstan, per inhabitant, 200 
kg of various chemical compounds are released into the atmosphere per year, while in 2000 this indicator was 163 
kg [1]. 
The number of vehicles is growing every year, private-sector heating systems are improving, the emissions of 
which are carried out in the surface layer of the atmosphere above the territory of industrial centers, new 
technologies for controlling harmful emissions appear, but despite this, the quality of the air leaves much to be 
desired. Therefore, the development of methodologies for reducing pollutant emissions, means of monitoring and 
controlling the level of pollution in order to reduce the technogenic impact on the atmosphere is currently relevant. 
1. Problem, relevance 
The object of the study is the ecological state of the air environment of the city of Almaty and the region, 
emissions and variability of concentrations of pollutants. 
The subject of the study is the anthropogenic and meteorological conditions of air pollution, which determine the 
concentration of the main pollutants of the air basin. 
The study of large amounts of data, in modern terminology defined as ""big data"", is a key element in the theory of 
the ""Fourth Paradigm of Science"" proposed by the Turing Prize winner, American scientist Dr. James Nicholas 
Gray. [2] Gray suggests that the collection and analysis of large volumes of statistical data, made possible by the 
widespread dissemination of computer systems, provides the world with a fundamentally new approach to research 
and will allow a fresh look at many problems of modern science. A mathematical analysis of the data will help to 
identify patterns and increase the accuracy of the final conclusions, which would be impossible for smaller samples. 
That is why it is important to provide both a large number of sources of such data and the most simplified access to 
them. The latter also reflects such a common concept in the scientific community as “open data”, i.e. providing free 
access to data to everyone, so that anyone can conduct research on them and thereby accelerate the solution of a 
specific scientific problem. For such studies in ecology in foreign sources, the term ""macro system ecology"" 
(macrosystems ecology, MSE) is used [2]. One of the approaches used in the ecology of macrosystems to obtain 
large amounts of data is precisely the use of extensible eco-monitoring systems that collect data on the current state 
of the environment. 
In cities, the environmental sustainability index is usually calculated from four sub-indices: air quality, CO2 
emissions, energy and indoor pollution. 
Existing ground-based information systems use data from meteorological and upper-air stations, data from water 
and aircraft, weather radar centers, and various atmospheric sounding systems. An important role is played by 
information obtained from artificial satellites of the Earth, as well as monitoring data of the cryosphere (state of 
snow and ice cover and permafrost zones). Also, climatic and ecological changes in the environment require 
monitoring of internal and external factors. External factors are factors caused by the influence of solar and cosmic 
radiation. The intensity of external factors of influence depends on solar activity, the parameters of the Earth’s orbit, 
and the Earth’s rotation speed. The effects of impacts are determined by the intensity of the impact factors, the 
properties and composition of the Earth’s atmosphere, and the properties of the earth’s surface. Internal factors 
influencing climate variability include thermal emissions and emissions of various substances into the biosphere, as 
well as their redistribution between different environments. 
Currently, in terms of analysis and assessment of environmental and technological hazards, an exclusive role is 
given to the environmental monitoring system. In this area, to predict the development of environmentally  
hazardous situations, the old practice based on observation, accumulation of data and compilation of bulletins of 
environmental pollution is not enough. Environmental monitoring is an information system for observing, assessing 
and forecasting changes in the state of the environment, created with the aim of highlighting the anthropogenic 
component of these changes against the background of natural processes. Speaking about the environmental 
monitoring system, we mean that it should accumulate, systematize and analyze information: on the state of the 
environment; the reasons for the observed and probable changes in the state (i.e., the sources and factors of 
influence); on the permissibility of changes and loads on the environment as a whole. In accordance with the above

definitions and the functions assigned to the system, three main areas of activity can be distinguished, which include 
environmental monitoring[3]: 
 monitoring of impact factors and the state of the environment; 
 assessment of the actual state of the environment; 
 prediction of the state of the environment and assessment of the forecasted state. 
It should also be noted that the monitoring system itself does not include environmental quality management 
activities, but it is a source of information necessary for making environmentally significant decisions. The 
systematic method of environmental monitoring is based on the examination of the environmental impact of harmful 
emissions on the environment and provides a comprehensive accounting of measurements and comparing them with 
standard indicators expressed through qualitative and quantitative characteristics of environmental safety. The 
method of environmental impact assessment in the development of the system contains a set of measures, including 
identification, analysis, tracking and monitoring of environmental risks from their planned values. Environmental 
monitoring, implied in this work, is a system of mobile observation points for the state of air pollution in the territory 
of Almaty, in particular for the spread of pollutants from stationary sources of pollution, i.e. from industrial 
enterprises. The largest volume is observed in manufacturing enterprises (45,9%). 
The project involves the creation of a software and hardware complex for environmental monitoring. 
2. Problem, relevance 
To solve the problems of forecasting and monitoring the ecology, climate and meteorological conditions, it was 
decided to develop a platform for collecting and transmitting heterogeneous data in Almaty and Almaty region. 
The main goal of the system is monitoring air quality, forecasting, assessing and identifying trends in the state of 
the atmosphere to prevent negative consequences that adversely affect human health and the environment. This 
allows real-time monitoring of the environment and meteorological conditions, as well as monitoring of all major 
pollution sources for making subsequent management decisions. When designing the system, the following 
requirements were established: low cost of creation and operation, autonomy of the end measuring stations, 
scalability, online access to the collected data, data security and stability of the system as a whole. 
A diagram of a fragment of the network of the system was developed on the basis of an analysis of the  
parameters necessary for assessing the ecological situation, specific terrain, and the development of the city. The 
scheme consists of data collectors, which include several local and one base station. Data collectors are located in 
different parts of the city. Within the region, data collection is based on LoRa (Low Range) technology. Data 
transmission from data collectors is carried out using cellular mobile communication systems. Each local station is 
mobile. The local station includes sensors for measuring the necessary parameters, electronic processing devices, a 
LoRa radio module with technology. The base station is stationary. It also contains sensors for measuring 
parameters, electronic processing devices, as well as equipment for transmitting information over cellular networks 
(GSM or LTE standard) and a LoRaWAN gateway. Data received from local and base stations is transmitted to the 
server and can be additionally available to the system user via the web interface or mobile application, as well as to 
third-party software products via API (Application Programming Interface). 
The core of each local station is a board based on the ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) Cortex-M3 controller, 
and the core of each base station is a single-board computer based on the ARM Cortex microprocessor - A53. Gas 
analyzers and other measuring equipment connected to them. A list of air pollutants was determined, the 
concentrations of which should be controlled. This list includes substances such as carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, 
ozone, methane and suspended particles in the air. Also a station for connecting temperature, humidity, pressure, 
GPS sensors. Stations can be equipped at the request of the user, depending on the installation location. 
As a data transmission technology, a network based on the LoRa standard was chosen. As mentioned earlier, the 
low data rates in the LoRa network are offset by the large coverage area with low power consumption. Among other 
things, LoRa networks use the unlicensed radio frequency range LPD433 (Low Power Device) and the ISM 
(industrial, scientific and medical) band 915 MHz [4], which will allow you to quickly deploy the network without 
additional permissions, as well as expand it with new devices as needed without a monthly fee.[4].

Local stations collect data from the sensors and transmit them to the nearest base station (LoraWAN gateway). If 
no base station is within range of the local station, data is stored on a removable SD card. As soon as the local 
station re-enters the coverage area of the base station, all the accumulated information will be automatically sent to 
the base station. The base station also collects readings at the installation site and transfers the received information 
to the server, and not for processing. In addition to stations, the LoRa network has a management server that 
organizes the transfer of data from end devices to the storage server and vice versa. The network server resolves 
network collisions, changes the transmitter power and data transfer rate, monitors the battery power of the end 
devices, and sends data to the storage server. On the server for processing and storage of data is the extraction, 
storage and processing of data received from measuring stations. 
Third-party applications receive environmental data from the data processing and storage server, bring them in 
accordance with the units of measure adopted in the region, and display them to the end user both in the form of 
summary information from all stations and for each station on the network separately. Interactive maps, pivot tables, 
histograms are used to visually display information available both through the website and through the mobile 
application. 
The developed scheme, implemented on a modern elemental base, will provide the statistical data necessary for 
the analysis of an automatic network to collect environmental and meteorological information at different times of 
the day, under different weather conditions. 
LoRa Node (End device) consists of several block diagrams listed below: 
 Block diagram for determining the coordinates of devices 
 A block diagram for storing information in memory 
 Block diagram of a real-time clock 
 LoRa radio module

The RAK811 radio module was used as a radio module. Radio module allows you to create a radio network type 
""star"". The module is equipped with a radio frequency transceiver, this transceiver has the ability to transmit data in 
urban areas at a distance of up to 5 km (line of sight-15 km). the module used a microcontroller STM32L151, this 
microcontroller has the same advantage as the amount of power consumption. The module can be controlled with 
simple AT commands. 
Different wireless technologies meet the needs of a particular application with changes in modulation schemes 
and frequency. Long-range devices with low bandwidth requirements (Fig. 2), which are typical for IoT 
applications, are poorly supported by these existing technologies. LPWAN is designed for similar applications and 
devices. [5] 
One possible solution to the problem of wireless network connections with cellular topology is ZigBee 
technology. The main disadvantage of this technology is the limited bandwidth supply due to the high data rate and 
low receiver sensitivity. Some ZigBee connections have problems sending data over a distance of more than 20-30 
meters, as the energy coming from the transmitter is lost too quickly. 
Instead of a mesh network, most LPWAN technologies use a star-shaped network. As with Wi-Fi, star network 
endpoints connect directly to the access point. It is also possible to use a repeater to easily fill gaps in coverage, 
which for most applications is a good intermediate solution in terms of latency, reliability, and coverage. 
To achieve a long distance in wireless communication, a large channel reserve is required. In other words, when a 
signal is transmitted, it needs enough energy to detect when received. Because a certain amount of energy is lost in 
the process of spreading through space and the materials in between. 
Fig. 2 - Range of different wireless technologies 
LPWAN (Low Power WAN) technologies typically operate at 140-160 decibels (dB) of the total path, which can 
increase the range to several kilometers under suitable conditions. This is primarily achieved due to the high 
sensitivity of the receiver. Receiver sensitivity of more than -130 dBm is common for LPWAN technologies 
compared to the -90 to -110 dBm seen in many traditional wireless technologies. The -130 dBm technology can 
detect signals 10,000 times weaker than the -90 dBm technology, which is a significant advantage of LPWAN[5]. 
3. Results and Discussions 
In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). Descriptive statistics is a summary of statistics that quantitatively describes 
or sums up a feature of information collection, while descriptive statistics in the mass sense is the process of using 
and analyzing these statistics. The EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data, while the CDA focuses on

confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. In this article, we used descriptive statistics because the data contains a 
simple summary of the sample and the observations made. Also since descriptive analysis includes one-factor 
analysis, where one-factor analysis includes a description of the distribution of a single variable, including its 
Central trend (including mean, median, and mode) and variance (including the range and quartiles of the dataset, as 
well as propagation measures such as variance and standard deviation)). 
Authors [7] proposed a solution for semi-empirical equation of turbulent diffusion to calculate the average of the 
impurity concentration in the boundary layer of the atmosphere from an instantaneous point source. 
For visual statistics, the Google Collaborator tool was used, aimed at simplifying research in the field of machine 
and deep learning. The advantages of this service, you can get remote access to the machine with a connected video 
card, and completely free of charge, which greatly simplifies life when you have to train deep neural networks. 
Air pollution data is presented as a csv file it has 11403 instances of training data. 
In figure 3, all 24 attributes have missing values, 5 more than 50% of all data. In most cases, NA means the 
absence of the subject described by the attribute, for example, the absence of data on certain days for technical or 
other reasons. 
As it can be seen in figure 3, the largest amount of data is missing in columns 15 and 17, and columns 2 and 6 
have almost all the values. It is also worth noting that 100 percent of the completed data in this file is not. Therefore, 
it is necessary to remove all empty cells, that is, to get rid of hidden data. 11403 is clean, cleaned data. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of the data in 3 forms. Grand Total is the average for each row. Figure 4-a 
used the Johnson distribution, figure 4-b used the normal distribution, figure 5 the lognormal distribution, where the 
x coordinate represents the values of pollutants, and the y coordinate represents the percentage of occurrence of the 
corresponding indicators.

The Johnson's SU-distribution is a four-parameter family of probability distributions first investigated by N. L. 
Johnson in 1949. 
The normal distribution of data is a pattern of occurrence of its different values. A lognormal distribution in 
probability theory is a two-parameter family of absolutely continuous distributions. If a random variable has a 
lognormal distribution, then its logarithm has a normal distribution. 
Obviously, Grand Total does not follow the normal distribution, so it must be converted before performing the 
regression. While log conversion works pretty well, Johnson's unrestricted distribution works best.

The mass concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter) is a key parameter for assessing air quality and its threat to 
human health. According to the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO), the average annual level of 
PM2.5 should not exceed 10 µg / m3, and the average daily level should not exceed 25 µg / m3. In the meantime, as 
it can be seen on the Table 1, concentration of PM2.5 within the city of Almaty perceptibly exceeds the 
recommended values which affects on the health of citizens of the region in particular infectious diseases like 
tuberculosis[8].

The system developed during the research will help optimize the process of taking readings from various remote 
sensors installed in the studied region using modern LPWAN radio access technologies. The mobile monitoring 
system is implemented based on the construction of a radio access network of the LPWAN technology using various 
remote sensors of climatic and environmental conditions in the territory of the metropolis. 
The study provides a detailed analysis based on Google Сolaboratory cloud services to identify deviations from 
the standard value of monitoring climatic and environmental conditions. The authors came to certain regularities, 
such as the dependence on the time of year, weather and location of certain industrial facilities near the observed 
zone. It is also revealed that the concentration of suspended particles in the air exceeds the norm by 2 times most of 
the observed time period, and the possible consequences of this are considered. Of the 23 points, it was also 
determined which were more polluted and which were less. The authors also came to the conclusion that in the 
winter months showed air pollution revealed the highest rate than in the summer months.

From Table 1 we can conclude that the most air polluted points are:  
1. Point 108 (Jean Kairat) with a value of 109.4 
2. Point 7 (Kok Kainar) with value 83.7 
3. Point 1 (Seifullina - Dulatova) with a value of 71.2 
Future research on data prediction will be concluded as well as development of SMS or other ways of notification 
of citizens on the environmental composition of the area.

Welcome	to	the	5th	International	Conference	on	Engineering	and	MIS	2019	(ICEMIS	2019).	We	
are	 pleased	 in	 the	 interest	 that	 this	 conference	 receives	 from	 the	 research	 and	 practitioner	
communities	with	representative	from	Kazakhstan	and	abroad.	
	
First	 of	 all,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	 to	 thank	 the	 International	 Association	 of	
Researchers	(IARES	Inc.,	Canada)	for	their	support	throughout	all	the	preparation	stages	for	this	
conference.	Without	their	help	and	cooperation	ICEMIS	2019	would	not	have	been	possible.	
	
As	part	of	our	ongoing	effort	to	effectively	contribute	in	the	development	of	research	within	the	
middle-east	region,	we	aim	for	this	conference	to	be	the	seed	for	many	more	conferences	to	come.	
ICEMIS	2019	aims	to	bring	together	academics,	researchers,	and	students	in	order	to	offer	the	
chance	for	everyone	to	present	their	work	and	scientific	achievements,	and	exchange	expertise	in	
the	 fields	 of	 applied	 engineering,	 computing,	 Cloud,	 IoT,	 Fog	 computing,	 Big	 Data	 and	 other	
related	topics.		The	ICEMIS	2019	proceedings	will	be	included	in	the	ACM	Digital	Library.	
	
As	shown	in	the	reference	section,	after	the	fabulous	success	in	ICEMIS	2015,	2016,	2017,	2018	
and	2019	[1-91];	ICEMIS	series	builds	on	the	last	five	years'	successful	events	and	brings	together	
academics	and	practitioners	in	the	fields	of	engineering,	computing,	information	technology,	and	
management	information	systems.	Finally,	I	would	like	to	thank	all	those	who	have	contributed	
towards	the	success	of	this	conference,	especially	the	members	of	the	organizing	committee,	the	
proceedings	committee,	and	everyone	else	who	made	a	contribution.	To	all	the	participants	and	
volunteers	of	ICEMIS	2019,	I	hope	you	find	this	conference	a	rewarding	experience	which	will	aid	
you	towards	more	achievements,	and	I	wish	you	a	pleasant	and	enjoyable	stay	in	Kazakhstan.

ABSTRACT 
In this article, the problem of monitoring of climatic and ecological 
condition of the region is considered. The problem of 
environmental pollution in large cities is very significant, and 
modern monitoring systems have a number of significant 
drawbacks: low speed of deployment, large size of stations, and 
high cost of maintenance. The authors propose a new approach to 
the construction of such systems using the technologies of the 
""Internet of things"". This will make it possible to create easily 
scalable low-cost systems with high energy efficiency through the 
use of modern communication technologies.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Pollution of the environment by industrial enterprises and vehicles, 
causing degradation of the environment and causing damage to 
public health, remains the most acute environmental problem of 
priority social and economic importance. Therefore, the 
development of methodologies to reduce emissions of pollutants 
means of pollution control and management in order to reduce the 
anthropogenic impact on the atmosphere is currently relevant. The 
environmental monitoring system plays an exceptional role in the 
analysis and assessment of environmental and technological 
hazards. 
Existing environmental monitoring systems allow the collection 
and analysis of a wide range of necessary information on the state 
of the environment. However, their establishment, deployment and 
operation, even within a single city, are very labor-intensive 
processes, resulting in substantial regional and municipal budget 
expenditures. There is a need for operational environmental 
monitoring in this area, which means that a new strategy and new 
methods are needed to focus on immediate and future trends and 
priorities. One of the solutions to this situation can be the use of 
modern information technologies, in particular, the ""Internet of 
things"" (IoT). In this connection, one of the main objectives of this 
study is to analyze the applicability of the technologies of the 
""Internet of things"" in the interests of the environment. At the 
beginning, it is planned to conduct a market research of existing 
environmental monitoring systems and solutions based on ""Internet 
of things"" technologies, as well as to develop its own concept of the 
system of this class. 
This article discusses monitoring systems designed to determine the 
state of the environment in urban agglomerations and suburban 
areas. The system developed in the course of the study will help to 
optimize the process of taking readings from various remote 
sensors installed in the study region using modern LPWAN radio 
access technologies. The system of mobile monitoring is 
implemented based on building a network of radio access 
technology LPWAN using a variety of remote sensors of climatic 
and environmental conditions in the metropolis. 
2. EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL 
MONITORING SYSTEMS 
In the ""Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan"" article 
141 identifies the following types of environmental monitoring [1]: 
• Monitoring of the state of atmospheric air is a system of 
observations of the state of air pollution in the settlements 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
• Monitoring of soil condition-a system of observations of 
the state of technological soil pollution on the lands of 
settlements, irrigated areas and agricultural lands. 
• meteorological 
monitoring-system 
of 
integrated 
meteorological observations 
• Radiation monitoring-a system of observations of 
technological and natural radioactive contamination of 
environmental objects and territories. 
• Monitoring of transboundary pollution - a system of 
observations carried out in the framework of international 
cooperation with border States on the state of 
transboundary waters and transboundary air pollution, as 
well as the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent, limit 
and reduce transboundary environmental impact. 
• Background monitoring - a system of observations of the 
state of the atmosphere and other media in their interaction 
with the biosphere at a specialized network of stations for 
integrated background environmental monitoring. 
Currently, observations of the state of atmospheric air are carried 
out by RSE ""Kazhydromet"" in 49 settlements at 146 observation 
posts, including 56 manual sampling posts and 90 automatic posts. 
Moreover, observations are carried out with the help of 14 mobile 
laboratories. 
Observations of the state of atmospheric air are carried out [2]: 
• Incomplete program (3 times a day – 07, 13, 19 hours.); 
• Full program (four one-time 01, 07, 13, 19 hours); 
• On an abbreviated program (twice 07 and 13 hours.); 
• In continuous mode 90 automatic posts. 
Existing up to the present time monitoring system of atmospheric 
pollution, based on the selection of samples and their subsequent 
analysis do not correspond to modern requirements from the point 
of view of labor costs, automatic continuous measurements. 
Therefore, in order to solve such problems related to monitoring 
and forecasting of climate-ecological changes, the work aimed at 
automated control systems with new modern technical means is of 
great importance. 
For example, the monitoring system of Almaty, where all types of 
monitoring listed above are carried out by the Ministry of Energy 
of Kazakhstan, RSE ""Kazhydromet"". However, the main drawback 
of this system is the inability to monitor the readings in real time. 
In this connection, in addition to the official monitoring systems for 
the state of the environment, there were private projects such as 
AUA and AirKAZ. 
In the framework of the system AirKaz observation is conducted in 
5 districts of Almaty city. Measurements are carried out by a dust 
meter using a laser sensor to calculate the field particles per unit 
time. Depending on the particle size, they are divided into PM 1.0, 
PM2.5 and PM10, and each species is measured separately. 
In September 2018, a mobile application ""AirKZ"" of RSE 
""Kazhydromet"" was created to monitor the air quality in 
Kazakhstan. With its help, the user can monitor the air quality 
throughout Kazakhstan. In AirKZ, data are available for 46 
settlements and 84 environmental posts. The user can manually 
select the necessary posts, or the application will automatically 
determine the nearest post according to the geolocation data [3]. 
Project AUA, launched in 2017, is using the dust meter BAM-1020 
established in the territory of KazNMU them. S. D. Asfendiyarov. 
The Kazakhstan Institute of Metrology carried out verification of 
the measured readings. In the future, based on this project, a mobile 
application was created [4].  
Automated Industrial Emission Control System NL-2308 
(“HORIBA 
Scientific”), 
Automated 
Pollution 
Control 
System(Scientific Production Company “DIEM”), Atmospheric 
pollution control stations(«IMC SYSTEMS»), Atmospheric 
pollution control -A( Ecros Engineering) [5].  
In 2016, the Eco-routes service was launched in Nizhny Novgorod, 
which determines the pollution of the urban environment by vehicle 
emissions in real time [6]. This system works as follows: on the 
map of the city you need to mark the start and end points of your 
route and click ""assess risk"". After that, the service makes 
calculations and reports the degree of air pollution on the route. In 
the calculation of the concentration of nitrogen oxides NOx using 
mathematical Gaussian model of dispersion of pollutants in the 
atmosphere. 
In addition, in the article [7] there are examples of web technologies 
used, where the key elements of the new interface are the 
background base map and observation data in the form of a 
translucent layer. The user of the web application is provided with 
controls such as the selection of one of the indicators and the time 
interval. With the help of additional tools, you can view data with 
a certain time step in one direction. To search for anomalies, the 
data output is provided as a graph of maximum values with a quick 
transition to viewing the data at a certain point in time. 
In the implementation of global monitoring systems, special 
attention is paid to monitoring the state of the environment from 
space. Where it is possible to obtain unique information on the 
functioning of various ecosystems at the regional and global levels, 
on the levels of natural disasters and ecological catastrophes with 
the help of the earth's space remote sensing (ERS) system. For 
example, the US global monitoring system Environmental 
Observation System (EOS), which is based on the processing of 
data obtained from three satellites equipped with video 
spectrometers, radiometers, radio altimeters and other equipment 
[8].

collection and processing of data

emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere 
Figure 1 shows the system of data collection and processing where 
the full range of monitoring tasks is solved: 
• the definition of the critical objects of monitoring polluting 
emissions; 
• determination of the control method for each object 
emitting harmful substances; 
• the determination of the placement and the necessary 
equipment of the control points; 
• collection of sensor data about the levels of concentration 
of pollutants; 
• primary processing of time series of measurements 
obtained from control points and comparison of data with 
standard values; 
• assessment of the current state of atmospheric emissions 
and output of the necessary information to the user; 
• accumulation and storage of information in the databases 
of the monitoring system; 
• geographic information display of current data with 
reference to the terrain and objects of control at the local 
level. 
 
 
Figure 2-Subsystem of secondary processing of time series of 
pollutant emissions into the atmosphere 
According to the structure of the subsystem of secondary 
processing of time series of data of emissions of pollutants into the 
atmosphere, the following tasks are solved: 
• pre-processing of time series of data on emissions of 
pollutants into the atmosphere 
• getting the forecasted data about change of level of 
pollutants; 
• calculation and evaluation of the risk function of 
emergency situations; 
• support in making decisions aimed at minimizing possible 
damage, as well as decisions on the necessary measures to 
eliminate excess emissions [9]. 
3. THE TECHNOLOGY USED FOR DATA 
TRANSFER IN THE SYSTEM OF 
ECOLOGICAL MONITORING 
Environmental monitoring is an extensive application for the 
Internet of things, which includes everything from monitoring the 
level of carbon dioxide in the premises of industrial enterprises to 
monitoring national parks for the presence of smoke. The use of 
IoT technologies can simplify and make more efficient the time-
consuming process of environmental monitoring. 
Below is a list of the six most common uses of IoT for 
environmental monitoring, a few considerations when choosing an 
IoT network, and why a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) 
might be the best solution. 
• Monitoring of air quality for carbon dioxide, carbon oxides, 
sulphur, nitrogen, organic compounds, heavy metals and 
particulate matter 
• Monitoring of water quality, pollutants, thermal pollutants, 
chemical leaks, lead and flood levels 
• Monitoring soil moisture and vibration levels to detect and 
prevent landslides 
• Monitoring of forests and protected lands from forest fires 
• Monitoring of natural disasters such as earthquake and 
tsunami warnings 
• Monitoring snow levels in ski resorts and national parks to 
track weather and prevent avalanches. 
The use of IoT allows using various sensors, meters and gas 
analyzers to monitor changes in the environmental situation in 
different areas, type and purpose. IoT systems enable you to build 
a flexible, scalable, and fault-tolerant system with low 
implementation and maintenance costs. 
The ability to monitor the slightest changes in real time will allow 
taking timely measures to reduce or eliminate the harmful effects 
on the environment. Among the available features of smart-devices 
there are such as monitoring of seismic activity, weather 
conditions, changes in the composition of the atmosphere, soil and 
water bodies, monitoring the vibration field of rocks in order to 
prevent mudflows and many other examples. 
The collection of various indicators is the first step towards 
improving the environment, improving the safety of citizens and 
the preservation of natural resources of any state. 
Recently, personal environmental devices and monitoring 
applications have become increasingly popular. The possibilities of 
such devices are very extensive, from the product of measurements 
of the environment (air composition, temperature, humidity, etc.) 
to measure the level of radiation. Compact size and support for 
modern communication technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
allows you to use them 24/7 and track their readings remotely on 
your personal smartphone. 
An example of such devices is the development of air quality eggs 
(Fig. 3), implemented through a crowdsourcing company on 
Kickstarter in 2012 and awarded the ""Best project Kickstarter 
2012"". 
 
Figure 3 - Air Quality Egg 
 
Air Quality Egg is a Wi-Fi-enabled device that uses sensors to 
monitor changes in the levels of certain air pollutants. Each device 
can measure at least one air pollutant - NO2, CO2, CO, O3, SO2, 
particles and volatile organic compounds. It tracks any changes and 
automatically uploads the data to the cloud, where it can be 
accessed through a web portal, mobile application or manual 
download by connecting Egg to your computer. 
There are other examples of the use of IoT devices for 
environmental monitoring, such as sensor control illegal logging 
Invisible Tracck, the Bigbelly containers with sensors fullness with 
subsequent notification of public utilities of the city, and many 
other ""smart"" devices. 
Some considerations when selecting the type of network for the IoT 
to monitor the environment: 
• Bluetooth and BLE are often not suitable for long distance 
operation, making them not the best choice for 
environmental sensors. Wi-Fi also has long-distance 
performance limitations, and the infrastructure costs 
associated with setting up a Wi-Fi network can be 
prohibitive; 
• Mesh topologies such as ZigBee will also not work 
properly for monitoring the environment as the sensors are 
not close enough to each other (and may be on the ground), 
so obtaining reliable point-to-point connections will prove 
difficult; 
• Cellular M2M networks require a lot of energy, are 
expensive to deploy, and will not work in many rural areas 
without cellular services. 
All of the above makes LPWAN an ideal choice for environmental 
monitoring systems using IoT. 
Long-range energy efficient network (LPWAN) technology is ideal 
for environmental monitoring because it can connect devices that 
need to stay in range for a long period and send small amounts of 
data over long distances. Some IoT applications only need to 
transmit tiny amounts of information - for example, a sensor that 
sends data only if it detects smoke in the forest. 
There are two main areas where LPWAN technology is best-suited 
[10]: 
• Fixed connections with high density. In cities or buildings, 
LPWAN technology is an excellent alternative to cellular 
M2M connections. Some examples include intelligent 
lighting controllers, distribution automation (smart grid), 
and GPS resource tracking in campuses or cities; 
• Battery-powered devices where long-term operation is 
required. LPWAN can be a good example when you need 
more battery life than older technologies can provide. 
Examples include water meters, gas sensors, intelligent 
farming, and battery-powered door locks and access control 
points. 
Different wireless technologies meet the needs of a particular 
application with changes in modulation schemes and frequency. 
Long-range devices with low bandwidth requirements, which are 
typical for IoT applications, are poorly supported by these existing 
technologies. LPWAN targets similar applications and devices 
[11]. 
 
Figure 4-data sampling Algorithm 
 
One of the possible solutions to the problem of wireless network 
connections with cellular topology is ZigBee technology. The main 
disadvantage of this technology is the limited supply of bandwidth 
due to the high data rate and low sensitivity of the receiver. Some 
ZigBee connections have problems sending data over a distance of 
more than 20 to 30 meters because the power coming from the 
transmitter is lost too quickly. 
Instead of a mesh network, most of the LPWAN technologies use 
a star network. As with Wi-Fi, star-type network endpoints connect 
directly to the access point. In addition, it is possible to use a 
repeater to easily fill gaps in coverage, which for most applications 
is a good intermediate solution in terms of latency, reliability and 
coverage. 
In order to reach a large distance in wireless communication, a large 
channel reserve is required. In other words, when a signal is 
transmitted, it needs enough energy to be detected upon receipt. 
Because a certain amount of energy is lost in the process of 
spreading through space and materials between them. 
LPWAN technologies typically operate at 140-160 decibels (dB) 
from a common path, which can increase the range to several 
kilometers under suitable conditions. This is primarily achieved 
due to the high sensitivity of the receiver. The sensitivity of the 
receiver, comprising more than -130 dBm, is common for 
technologies LPWAN, compared with -90 to -110 dBm, which is 
observed in many traditional wireless technologies. Technology 
with -130 dBm can detect signals 10,000 times weaker than 
technology with -90 dBm, which is a significant advantage of 
LPWAN. 
There are a number of reasons to consider GPON technology for 
an environmental monitoring system: 
• Long battery life. After installing LPWAN sensors for 
couple of years, there is no need to replace the battery, 
which making them ideal for areas that are difficult to 
maintain. Many LPWAN technologies also allow to power 
the environmental sensors from solar panels, which is an 
excellent ""green"" method for remote areas; 
• Inexpensive. If you need to measure a large number of 
indicators, from air quality to forest fires, and require a 
relatively high sensor density, the use of LPWAN 
technology will reduce costs; 
• Higher range. End nodes and antennas of the LPWAN 
system can be deployed at a distance of 500 meters to 10 
kilometers from each other, depending on the technology. 
At the moment there are two LPWAN standards-Larawan and NB 
- IoT. LoRa is a patented frequency extension of the frequency 
spectrum. In 2008, the technology patent was granted to Cyclo 
(France), and in 2012 Cycleo acquired Semtech (USA). 
NB-IoT is developed by 3GPP group on the basis of existing mobile 
communication standards. There are two main versions of this 
specification: one released by Nokia, Ericsson and Intel, and the 
other by Vodafone&Huawei. LoRaWAN is an open Protocol for 
high-capacity (up to 1,000,000 devices in one network) networks 
with a large range and low power consumption, which 
LoRaAlliance has standardized for global networks with low power 
consumption (Low Power Wide Area Networks, LPWAN). The 
LoRaWAN network is organized as a star-type network and 
includes various classes (a, B and C) of nodes to optimize the trade-
off between information delivery speed and battery life. 
4. ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM 
To solve the problems of forecasting and monitoring of ecology, 
climate and meteorological conditions, it was decided to design a 
platform for the collection and transmission of heterogeneous 
environmental data in Almaty and Almaty region. 
The main purpose of the system is to monitor the air quality, 
forecast, assess and identify trends in the state of the atmosphere to 
prevent negative consequences that adversely affect human health 
and the environment. It allows real-time monitoring of 
environmental and meteorological conditions and monitoring of all 
major sources of pollution for subsequent management decisions. 
When designing the system, the following requirements were set: 
low cost of creation and operation, autonomy of end measurement 
stations, scalability, operational access to the collected data, data 
security and stability of the system as a whole. 
A scheme of the system network fragment was developed based on 
the analysis of the parameters necessary for the assessment of the 
environmental situation, the specifics of the relief and development 
of the city territory. The scheme consists of data collectors, which 
include several local and one base station (Fig. 5). Data collectors 
are located in different parts of the city. Within the area, the 
collection of data done based on LoRa technology. Data 
transmission from data collectors is carried out using cellular 
mobile communication systems.  Each local station is mobile. The 
structure of the local station includes sensors for measuring the 
necessary parameters, electronic processing devices, radio module 
LoRa technology. The base station is stationary. It also contains 
sensors for measuring parameters, electronic processing devices, as 
well as equipment for transmitting information over cellular 
networks (GSM or LTE standard) and LoRaWAN gateway. The 
data received from the local and base stations is transmitted to the 
server and can be further accessed by the user of the system through 
the web interface or mobile application, as well as third-party 
software products through the API. 
 
Figure 5-Block diagram of a network fragment 
 
The core of each local station is a Board based on ARM Cortex-M3 
controller, and the core of each base station is a single Board 
computer based on ARM Cortex – A53 microprocessor. Gas 
analyzing sensors and other measuring equipment connected to 
them. A list of air pollutants whose concentrations should be 
monitored was identified. This list includes substances such as 
carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, ozone, methane, and suspended 
particles in the air. Also station of the connected temperature 
sensors, humidity, pressure, GPS. Stations can be completed at the 
request of the user depending on the installation location. The 
architecture of the stations is shown in Fig. 6. 
 
Figure 6-Block diagram of a network fragment 
 
The network based on the LoRa standard was chosen as the data 
transmission technology. As mentioned earlier, low data rates in the 
LoRa network are compensated by a large area coverage with low 
power consumption. Among other things, LoRa networks use the 
unlicensed radio frequency range LPD433 and ISM-range 915 
MHz [12], which will allow to deploy the network in a short time 
without additional permissions, as well as to expand it with new 
devices as necessary without the cost of a subscription fee. 
In addition, a significant advantage of LoRa is the open hardware 
specifications of the data transmission module from SemTech and 
the existence of The Lora Alliance consortium. The Lora Alliance 
includes many major software and hardware manufacturers, such 
as Intel, IBM and Cisco, which gives confidence that this 
technology has prospects for development and presence in the 
market in the next few years [13]. 
Local stations collect data from sensors and transmit it to the 
nearest base station (LoraWAN gateway). If no base station is 
within range of the local station, the data is stored on a removable 
SD flash drive. As soon as the local station re-enters the coverage 
area of the base station, all accumulated information will be 
automatically sent to the base station. The base station also 
collected evidence at the place of installation, and transmit the 
obtained information to the server, not the processing. In addition 
to stations, there is a control server in the LoRa network that 
organizes data transfer from end devices to the storage server and 
back. The network server resolves network collisions, changes 
transmitter power and data rate, monitors the battery charge of end 
devices, and sends the data to the storage server. On the server of 
data processing and storage is the extraction, storage and 
processing of data obtained from measuring stations. Third-party 
applications receive data on the state of the environment from the 
data processing and storage server, bring them in line with the units 
of measurement adopted in the region and display to the end user 
both in the form of summary information from all stations and for 
each station in the network separately. Interactive maps, summary 
tables, histograms are used for visual display of information, 
available both through the website and through the mobile 
application. 
The developed scheme, implemented on a modern element base, 
will provide the statistical data necessary for the analysis of the 
automatic network for the collection of environmental and 
meteorological information at different times of the day, under 
different weather conditions.

"," in this article, the problem of monitoring of climatic and ecological condition of the region is considered. the problem of environmental pollution in large cities is very significant, and modern monitoring systems have a number of significant drawbacks: low speed of deployment, large size of stations, and high cost of maintenance. the authors propose a new approach to the construction of such systems using the technologies of the ""internet of things"". this will make it possible to create easily scalable low-cost systems with high energy efficiency through the use of modern communication technologies. ccs concepts • computer systems organization → embedded and cyber-physical systems → sensor networks ","['iot', 'ecology', 'environment', 'pwan', 'lorawan']",<generator object

Abstract: This article discusses the impact of suspended particles on human health, as well as the analysis of 
the level of pollution in Almaty over the past 2 years using descriptive statistics. Pollution of the environment 
by industrial enterprises and vehicles, causing degradation of the environment and causing damage to public 
health, remains the most acute environmental problem of priority social and economic importance. The problem 
of pollution of the environment of large cities is very significant and complex, requiring first of all long-term 
monitoring, then a deep and competent analysis of the assessment of the situation on the data obtained, for 
the subsequent prevention, localization and investigation of environmental disasters and incidents, making 
management decisions for further work on the development of improving the quality of atmospheric air, as 
well as forecasting the state of the environment. In this paper, we consider a specific case, namely particles 
PM2.5 — air pollutant, which consists of solid particles and liquid droplets ranging in size from 10 nm to 
2.5 microns. The fact that air pollution by small particles is a global killer is already widely known, but these 
statements have not yet been confirmed by specific figures. The authors have identified certain patterns, such 
as dependence on the time of year, weather, and the location of certain industrial facilities near the observed 
zone. The indicators with the values in the form of graphs And revealed that the concentration of suspended 
particles in the air exceeds the norm by 2 times most of the observed period of time, and considered the 
possible consequences of this.

ЭКОЛОГИЯЛЫҚ МОНИТОРИНГТЕГІ СИПАТТАМА СТАТИСТИКАСЫ
Аңдатпа: Бұл мақалада өлшенген бөлшектердің адам денсаулығына әсер ету мәселесі қарастырылды, 
сондай-ақ Алматы қаласының соңғы 2 жылдағы ластану деңгейіне сипаттама статистикасын 
пайдалана отырып талдау жүргізілді. Қоршаған ортаны өнеркәсіп кәсіпорындары мен көлік 
құралдарының тіршілік ету ортасының тозуын тудыратын және халықтың денсаулығына зиян 
келтіретін ластануы басым әлеуметтік және экономикалық маңызы бар неғұрлым өткір экологиялық 
проблема болып қала береді. Ірі мегаполистердің қоршаған ортасының ластануы проблемасы ең 
маңызды және күрделі болып табылады, ол ең алдымен ұзақ мониторингті, содан кейін экологиялық 
апаттар мен инциденттерді кейіннен болдырмау, оқшаулау және тергеу, атмосфералық ауаның 
сапасын жақсартуды әзірлеу жөніндегі жұмыстарды одан әрі жүргізуге және басқарушылық 
шешімдер қабылдау үшін алынған деректер бойынша жағдайды бағалауды терең және сауатты 
талдауды талап етеді, сондай-ақ қоршаған ортаның жай-күйін болжау. Бұл жұмыста нақты 
жағдайға ерекше көңіл бөлінді, атап айтқанда, РМ2 бөлшектері.5-құрамына көлемі 10 нм-ден 2,5 
мкм-ге дейінгі қатты бөлшектер мен сұйықтық тамшылары кіретін ауа ластағышы. Ауаның ұсақ 
бөлшектермен ластануы жаһандық кісі өлтіруші болып табылатыны белгілі, бірақ бұл мәлімдемелер 
әлі күнге дейін нақты сандармен расталмаған.  Авторлар жыл мезгіліне, ауа райына және байқалатын 
аймаққа жақын белгілі бір өнеркәсіптік объектілердің орналасуына тәуелділік сияқты белгілі бір 
заңдылықтарды анықтады. Кесте түріндегі мәндері бар көрсеткіштер келтірілген. Сонымен қатар, 
ауадағы өлшенген бөлшектер концентрациясының көрсеткіштері байқалатын уақыт аралығының 
көп бөлігі нормадан 2 есе артық екені анықталды және осының ықтимал салдары қарастырылды.

ОПИСАТЕЛЬНАЯ СТАТИСТИКА В ЭКОЛОГИЧЕСКОМ МОНИТОРИНГЕ
Аннотация: В данной статье рассмотрен вопрос влияния взвешенных частиц на здоровье человека, 
а также проведен анализ уровня загрязнения города Алматы за  последние 2 года с использованием 
описательной статистики. Загрязнение окружающей среды предприятиями промышленности и 
транспортными средствами, вызывающее деградацию среды обитания и наносящее ущерб здоровью 
населения, остается наиболее острой экологической проблемой, имеющей приоритетное социальное и 
экономическое значение. Проблема с загрязнением окружающей среды крупных мегаполисов является 
весьма значимой и сложной, требующей в первую очередь длительного мониторинга, затем глубокого 
и грамотного анализа оценки ситуации по полученным данным, для последующего предотвращения, 
локализации и расследования экологических катастроф и инцидентов, принятия управленческих 
решений для дальнейшего ведения работ по разработке  улучшения качества атмосферного воздуха, 
а также прогнозирования состояния окружающей среды. В данной работе рассмотрен конкретный 
случай, а именно частицы РМ2.5 – воздушный загрязнитель, в состав которого входят твердые 
частицы и капли жидкости размером от 10 нм до 2,5 мкм. То, что загрязнение воздуха мелкими 
частицами является глобальным убийцей, уже широко известно, однако эти заявления до сих пор не 
подтверждались конкретными цифрами. Авторами выявлены определенные закономерности, такие 
как зависимость от времени года, погоды, и расположения определенных промышленных объектов 
вблизи наблюдаемой зоны. Приведены показатели со значениями в виде графиков. А также выявлено, 
что показатели концентрации взвешенных частиц в воздухе превышают норму в 2 раза большую часть 
наблюдаемого промежутка времени, и рассмотрены возможные последствия этого. 
Ключевые слова: загрязнитель воздуха, экологический мониторинг, описательная статистика
INTRODUCTION
Currently, much attention is paid to the pu-
rity of the surrounding air. In connection with 
this problem, the concept of suspended particles 
comes to the fore. Suspended particles (PM - 
particulate matter) are a widespread air pollutant 
comprising a mixture of solid and liquid parti-
cles in the air in suspension [1].
Particles with a mass concentration of par-
ticles with a diameter of less than 10 microns 
(PM10) and particles with a diameter of less 
than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) affect human health. 
PM2.5 particles are fine suspended particles, ul-
trafine particles with a diameter of less than 0.1 
microns are also included in this category.
The main problem with fine particles is that 
particles with a diameter of 0.1 μm to 1 μm can 
be in the air for many days and weeks, and as a 
result of this, the particles are transported over 
long distances through the air [1].
It is known that PM by type of origin are of 
two types: primary and secondary [2].
Primary particles are emitted into the at-
mospheric air in the “finished” form - these are 
the smallest pieces of soot, automobile tires and 
asphalt; heavy metal compounds (for example, 
oxides), mineral salt particles (such as sulfates, 
nitrates), as well as biological pollutants (some 
allergens and microorganisms).
Secondary suspended particles are formed 
directly in the atmosphere as a result of chemi-
cal reactions of gaseous pollutants. For example, 
oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are introduced into 
the air, which, when in contact with water, form 
acids, and solid particles of salts (nitrates and 
sulfates) are obtained from the acids.
In addition to the origin, suspended particles 
differ in the type of source: artificial (man-made) 
and natural (non-anthropogenic). The main 
source of anthropogenic particles is transporta-
tion (erosion of the road surface, erasing brake 
pads and tires) and industrial processes with 
burning solid fuels (coal, lignite, oil), construc-
tion, mining, many types of production (espe-
cially the production of cement, ceramics, brick 
smelting). Sources of natural particles include 
such phenomena as soil erosion in arid areas and 
organic evaporation.
Suspended particles are dangerous because 
they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs and 
settle there [3].

Particles of PM2.5 pass through the biolog-
ical barriers of the body: the nasal cavity, upper 
respiratory tract, bronchi. Particles of PM2.5 to-
gether with air fall directly into the alveoli - the 
bubbles in which gas exchange occurs between 
the lungs and blood vessels. Therefore, not only 
the respiratory system, but also the cardiovascu-
lar disease is associated with suspended particles.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
conducted a study that deals with the effects of 
suspended particles on human health. WHO con-
cluded that between 1999 and 2010, 3.1 million 
people died from the causes of PM2.5 particles. 
In addition, it was found that PM2.5 particles 
lead to a decrease in life expectancy by an aver-
age of 8.6 months [4]. Thus, PM2.5 particles are 
associated with 3% of deaths from diseases of the 
cardiovascular and respiratory systems and 5% 
of deaths from lung cancer.
The World Health Organization has con-
cluded that the harm is caused by the chronic ef-
fects of these particles on the human body. To 
date, there are no data indicating a safe level of 
exposure or a threshold level below which there 
are no health effects.
THE CASE OF ALMATY: AIR 
QUALITY MEASURES
The problem of air pollution in Almaty rises 
not the first year. It starts from the mid-90s, when 
everyone is hoping to attract the attention of the 
authorities and the public. And perhaps every-
thing becomes more obvious and tangible.
Polluted air is the world’s largest environ-
mental risk to human health. Almaty ranks first 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan for respiratory 
and endocrine system diseases, blood diseases, 
cancer and asthma, although there are no large 
industrial facilities in the region.
To improve the air quality in the city, a set 
of measures is needed, both from the government 
and from residents. The main sources of air pol-
lution are emissions from heat and power plants, 
road transport and the private sector.
The PMx fine dust measurement devices 
(PM2.5, PM10) PMS5003, which are used in 
the civil air quality monitoring network, in 2018 
were included in the register of the state system 
for ensuring the uniformity of measurements. 
These sensors are used in the largest civilian air 
monitoring network in Kazakhstan: on the site 
airkaz.org.
This type of equipment is also used by the 
largest international project launched in China 
“Air Quality Index”, which provides information 
on the degree of air pollution in more than 80 
countries with more than 10 thousand stations lo-
cated in 800 main cities of the world, in real time.
Conducting studies to assess the impact of 
the environment on human health is an important 
tool for demonstrating the need to take measures 
to improve air quality and reduce the negative 
impact of environmental factors.
Thus, it was decided to conduct a similar 
study in the city of Nice (France). It is based on 
data on air pollution in the region, obtained using 
the AirPaca service [5], which provides sensor 
readings in the public domain. The atmospheric 
air was measured in 6 areas: Contes 2, Aéroport 
de Nice, Nice Promenade des Anglais, Nice Ar-
son, Peillon, Nice Ouest Botanique. For informa-
tion about patients suffering from dyspnea, was 
used the archive of the hospital Pasteur (Nice). 
Dyspnea (shortness of breath) - a violation of the 
frequency and depth of breathing, accompanied 
by a feeling of lack of air.
For processing and storing the data used in 
this study, an information analysis system was 
developed using the Big Data approach, which 
made it possible to increase the efficiency of data 
analysis.
Big Data is information technologies for 
processing various structured and unstructured 
data of very large volumes in the context of con-
tinuous growth of data volumes and their dis-
tribution across numerous nodes of a computer 
network [6].
IMPLEMENTATION AND 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In statistical applications, data analysis can 
be divided into descriptive statistics , analytical 
data analysis (EDA), and supporting data anal-
ysis (CDA). Descriptive statistics is a summary 
of statistics that quantitatively describes or sums 
up a feature of information collection, while de-
295
ИНТЕЛЛЕКТУАЛЬНЫЕ СИСТЕМЫ
scriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the 
process of using and analyzing these statistics. 
EDA focuses on discovering new features in the 
data, while CDA focuses on confirming or fal-
sifying existing hypotheses . In this article, we 
applied descriptive statistics because the data 
contains a simple summary of the sample and the 
observations made. Also since descriptive analy-
sis involves univariate analysis, where univariate 
analysis includes a description of the distribution 
of a single variable, including its Central trend 
(including mean , median, and mode ) and vari-
ance (including the range and quartiles of the 
dataset, as well as dissemination measures such 
as variance and standard deviation). ).
For visual statistics, we used Google Colab-
oratory, which is not so long ago appeared cloud 
service aimed at simplifying research in the field 
of machine and deep learning. The advantages 
of this service, you can get remote access to the 
machine with a connected video card, and com-
pletely free of charge, which greatly simplifies 
life when you have to train deep neural networks.
Data on air pollution are presented in the 
form of a csv file, it has 11403 instances of the 
training data.
In Figure 1, all 24 attributes have missing 
values, 5 more than 50% of all data. In most cas-
es, NA means the absence of the subject described 
by the attribute, for example, the absence of data 
on certain days due to technical or other reasons. 
As you can see in Figure 1, columns 15 and 
17 do not have the largest data, and columns 2 
and 6 have almost all values. It is also worth not-
ing that 100 percent of the filled data in this file 
is not. Therefore, we have to remove all empty 
cells, that is, get rid of hidden data. 11403 are 
clean, cleared data.
In Figure 2, 3, 4 are presented in 3 types of 
data distribution. The Grand total is the average 
for each row. 2 used the figure of the Johnson dis-
tribution, in figure 3 used a normal distribution 4 
log-normal distribution, where x-coordinate, the 
values presented in pollutants. A on the coordi-
nate d represents the percentage of occurrence of 
the relevant indicators.

Figure 2 – Johnson SU distribution
 
Figure 3 – Normal distribution
Figure 4 – Log Normal distribution
Johnson’s SU-distribution for a parameter 
of a family of probability distributions was first 
investigated by L. N. Johnson in 1949. Johnson 
proposed it as a transformation of the normal dis-
tribution. [7]:
Where  
The normal distribution of data is a pattern 
of occurrence of its different values.
The lognormal distribution in probability 
theory is a two-parameter family of absolutely 
continuous distributions. If a random variable 
has a lognormal distribution, its logarithm has a 
normal distribution. 
It is obvious that Grand Total does not follow 
a normal distribution, so it must be transformed 
before regression can be performed. While the 
log conversion works pretty well, Johnson’s un-
restricted distribution works best.
In Figure 5,6,7,8 at points 1, 2, 3, 4 that is, 
at street intersections for points 1 - Seifullin – 
Dulatov; 2 - Alfarabi – Markov; 3 - Abay–Tle-
ndiev; 4 - Gorky Park; values range from 0 to 
750, where the x-coordinate is the value of air 
pollution(PM2.5), the y-coordinate percentage 
of the occurrence of values. As can be seen at 
1-4 points, the percentage of occurrence of the 
value of 40-2%, 50 -17.5% , 50 - about 2%, 50 
–35%, respectively. It is worth noting that values 
greater than 360 are available at point 2.you can 
see that Grand Total does not follow the normal 
distribution, so you must convert it before you 
can perform the regression. While the log con-
version works pretty well, Johnson’s unrestricted 
distribution works best.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Mass concentration of PM2.5 is a key pa-
rameter for assessing air quality and its threat 
to human health. According to the norms of the 
world health organization (who) the average an-
nual level of PM2.5 shall not exceed 10 µg/m3 
and the average daily level shall not exceed 25 
µg/m3.
Knowing the above standards and shown the 
following indicators of the city of Almaty for the 
last 2 years (2017(from 22 March)-2018-2019(to 
25 March)) with the average, after the analysis 
we can draw the following conclusion:
As we can see in Table 1 have shown in 
every column number of values, mean value, 
standard deviation, minimum value, maximum 
value, each cell has 25, 50, 75 percent of the cor-
responding data.
",": this article discusses the impact of suspended particles on human health, as well as the analysis of the level of pollution in almaty over the past 2 years using descriptive statistics. pollution of the environment by industrial enterprises and vehicles, causing degradation of the environment and causing damage to public health, remains the most acute environmental problem of priority social and economic importance. the problem of pollution of the environment of large cities is very significant and complex, requiring first of all long-term monitoring, then a deep and competent analysis of the assessment of the situation on the data obtained, for the subsequent prevention, localization and investigation of environmental disasters and incidents, making management decisions for further work on the development of improving the quality of atmospheric air, as well as forecasting the state of the environment. in this paper, we consider a specific case, namely particles pm2.5 — air pollutant, which consists of solid particles and liquid droplets ranging in size from 10 nm to 2.5 microns. the fact that air pollution by small particles is a global killer is already widely known, but these statements have not yet been confirmed by specific figures. the authors have identified certain patterns, such as dependence on the time of year, weather, and the location of certain industrial facilities near the observed zone. the indicators with the values in the form of graphs and revealed that the concentration of suspended particles in the air exceeds the norm by 2 times most of the observed period of time, and considered the possible consequences of this.","['air', 'pollutant', 'environmental', 'monitoring', 'descriptive']",<generator object
